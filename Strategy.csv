1,"49) banks into more Nordic collaboration and we saw an increase in Internet fraud and crime as when the currency   our capital controls were lifted, and this is our answer to that, to be part of more international collaboration and we've always been very much into security, but we are now taking it to another level and leading the discussion. We emphasize in our strategy, we emphasize initiative, accessibility and I mentioned digitalization which is now a focus across both corporate and retail business. Efficiency in operations and that means we're not going to window dress up this digitalization, we're going to take it all the way through."
1,"5 billion or 14% and total advisory AUM by more than $2 billion or 21%; improving HD Vest revenue by 10%; achieving our 20th consecutive year of revenue growth at TaxAct, growing 15%; and last but not least, bringing in great new talent throughout the organization, certainly including Bob and Sanjay as well as several new board members. Together the team developed and rolled out our strategy and generated outstanding financial results for 2017 while investing the business to support future growth. As I approach my second anniversary with Blucora, I am excited as ever about the prospects of this company."
1,"5 days, allowing us to grow volumes by approximately 10 million tons, by holding working capital relatively flat compared with last year. In sum, we remain and will continue to be laser focused on the strategic priorities, which will drive improvements in our commercial and industrial operations, while also reducing costs. Now, turning to slide number 4, looking to 2018, there are a number of factors that we expect will lead to year-over-year improvements in all segments."
1,"5 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, slightly higher than the guidance provided at the end of the third quarter. We are pleased with the results of our strategic initiatives involving mortgage banking, treasury management, credit and debit cards, and payroll services which in aggregate increased $1. 2 million or 8."
1,"5 million impact in 2017. Turning now to slide 16 it is helpful to remember our strategy of converting sales to rentals has a short term impact on EBITDA. In the Home Services segment, had all HVAC rental units added during the year been recorded as sales, revenue and EBITDA for the year would've increased by $40."
1,"5 million partner stylists are working with our brands, but it is definitely a positive shift for the division and for the professional market. Based on our last quarter and the strategic plan, we are confident to show accelerated growth in 2018. Thank you for your attention."
1,"5 million, up $1 million, driven by increases in interest income, primarily related to LIBOR earning assets and improvement in realized gains from sales of non-performing mortgage loans. As we go forward, while volatility related to our mark-to-market investments are expected to continue from quarter to quarter, our objectives remain the same, to balance our portfolio between cash and liquid short-term investments to cover claims and select alternative investments with a focus on enhanced risk-adjusted total returns over the long term. On page 10, we present the results of Tiptree Capital, where we allocate our capital across a broad spectrum of investments."
1,"5 million, which is relatively flat compared to the first quarter of last year. Strategic initiative number four is to attract, develop and retain outstanding tribe members. Our goal under this initiative is to attract, develop and retain talented tribe members and to grow tribe member engagement to greater than 95%."
1,"5 million. We have also a very strong execution of our inorganic growth strategy last year. As we already reported to you in previous quarters, the integration of the 2016 mergers and acquisitions, Equens and Paysquare and KB Smartpay is actually fully on track leading to an upgrade of the synergy target to â‚¬45 million at equensWorldline and to double-digit growth of both Paysquare and KB Smartpay."
1,"5% and our profits increased as well, as a result of our top line of strength coupled with G&A cost cuts implemented throughout 2017. We're obviously very pleased with our performance, which we can attribute to the effectiveness of our strategic initiatives coupled with a dedication of our employees who work hard every day delighting our guests. We're also encouraged that our sales momentum has continued so far into 2018 as we continue executing against the four main business drivers first outlined in 2017."
1,"5% core revenue growth and 110 basis points of core operating margin expansion or 55 points excluding the benefit from lower amortization. As a reminder, in early 2017, we outlined our strategic priorities and I'm pleased to report that we have met or exceeded all of them. In addition to delivering double-digit earnings growth, accelerated core growth, we delivered free cash flow conversion of 107% for the year."
1,"5% to 3. 5%, positive volume growth, and the rollover impact of acquisitions and the continued execution of our strategic initiatives. With that, I'll hand it over to Ed."
1,5%. I'd also like to provide more details on the increasing role re-development and densification opportunities will play in our long-term growth strategy. One of our primary goal this year is for our investors to have a clear and quantifiable understanding regarding the value embedded in our pipeline which is currently quantified to be over $400 million in spend today and growing as we entitle additional projects disclosed in the development section of our supplemental.
1,"5%. When we look at, as I said, demographics, we look at economic, we look at our capital policy, we look at our operational and strategic initiatives, we feel confident at this point in our 2% to 3% number."
1,"50) and that's continued here into the first quarter of 2018. And so, that is our leading strategic initiative as far as the revenue synergies from First Niagara and we will see a little bit of progress early in the year, but it'll start to build throughout the year. And so, we'll see a lot of traction pickup throughout the 2018 in connection with that, yeah."
1,"52) and information modulation and enhanced healing reasons. Let me turn it over now to Mark Landy, our SVP of Strategic Initiatives, and he'll take you through our clinical programs."
1,"54) clients to our company and create added scale. We are dedicated to driving long-term shareholder value by executing on the strategic initiatives that Doug discussed earlier, as this will result in continued growth in earnings per share and tangible book value per share. We look forward to continued success in 2018."
1,"55 best strong long-term risk-adjusted total returns. During the year, the group has made significant progress with strategic priorities. One of which is putting the customer first."
1,"55 per barrel. Now, let me take a moment to discuss our balance sheet, cash flow and our strategic priorities for creating long-term shareholder value. We made significant progress in 2017 on our strategies to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, invest for growth, and return cash to shareholders."
1,"56) producing only the optics and sensor solution, so that is our strategy and approach and that's something we are executing on."
1,"57) with about $125 million in cash and short-term investments, up from $102 million at the end of 2017, driven by EBITDA flow through and partially offset by the cost of acquiring T&C and changes in working capital. Now, to wrap up before opening it up to questions, 2017 was a good year, with important progress made across all of our strategic initiatives to drive long-term profitable growth. We remain focused on these initiatives, notably Care 3."
1,"59) is our strategy and that we then presented at Capital Market Day, including new financial targets in November, and as you maybe recall, if you attended that session, I've seen the material online, is basically divided in three sections. It's focused around extending our mobile leadership into senior phone segments and expanding Telecare, both organically and inorganically and then executing on the SmartCare and on top of that of course, we focus a lot on operational efficiency."
1,"6 billion cubic feet per day. Consistent with our strategy of constructing plants on a just-in-time basis, we initiated start-up of Sherwood IX at year-end. This is the first of three plants that we plan on completing at Sherwood in 2018."
1,"6 million to our shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends and more importantly, set ourselves up to improve our performance in 2018. We made significant progress on our key strategic priorities in 2017. We established and built out a core selling team in our new Nashville office."
1,"6 times the estimated average 2017 and 2018 EBITDA, including expected run rate synergies and tax benefits. The annual run rate EBITDA synergies are expected to be driven by mechanical revenue and cost efficiencies, while the revenue synergies will be driven by retransmission rate step-up in conjunction with leveraging of TEGNA's strategic initiatives within the San Diego market, digital marketing, products and pricing capabilities. Given the late close, the Midwest transaction's impact to the quarter will be minimal and will have a minimal impact on our net leverage ratio, increasing it initially by about two-tenths of a turn, and then returning to about four times by the end of 2018."
1,"6%, while retaining 79. 8% This granular approach to administering our renewal pricing strategy allows us to achieve additional loss ratio improvement through mix of business changes, while continuing to deliver pure rate increases that equal expected claims inflation. Drilling down to the results by line for commercial lines, our largest line of business, general liability, did not experience any reserve development during the quarter."
1,"6%. In summary, 2017 was an excellent year for our company as we continued to execute our strategic plans and goals. These are initiated through our culture of continuous improvement in all we do."
1,"6%. It is important to note, and I emphasize this, that the strategic initiatives will skew our investment in those strategic initiatives to the second half. So I wouldn't take our first half result and double it if you're thinking about the results for the period."
1,"6%. We also had the most active quarter of the year for capital recycling making significant progress in our strategic plan to reallocate capital to targeted industrial markets. We sold $300 million of office and industrial properties, acquired $195 million of industrial product in our targeted markets and delivered $690 million in new developments."
1,"62 per share, it represents an evolution of around 2. 5%, which takes into consideration on the one hand our will to offer an increased dividend to the shareholders, and on the other hand, our commitment to execute our organic growth strategy. And I give back the floor to Chris for commenting the outlook."
1,65. This 8% increase reflects the confidence in the execution of our strategic plan and our continued commitment to return cash to our shareholders not withstanding important organic growth investments. 2017 we accounted for non-recurring items amounting to a charge of â‚¬46 million on EBIT level and â‚¬42 million euros on net earnings.
1,"68 times. As such, we've adjusted our capital allocation strategy from a sole focus on repaying debt to a balanced approach, where we will continue to focus on deleveraging, but we will also begin to selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic growth investments within our core operation. With this, we have set a goal to grow revenues by $20 million to $40 million per year through acquisition or development activity."
1,69 billion grew 10% year-over-year and we're above our expectations. Our software-based solution strategy continues to work well. We're constantly pursuing new technologies and architectures for our customer.
1,"7 fix rate. This transaction further supports our strategy to drive the expansion of Grupo Bimbo's industry leadership, while enhancing our financial profile by increasing the average tenure of our debt to 11. 4 years and maintaining strength and flexibility in our balance sheet."
1,"7 million in proceeds from our February convertible offering and divested our pediatric products, both of which give us flexibility moving forward. We are fully capitalized to complete our strategic initiatives and, again, have the opportunity to continue exploring additional strategic acquisitions that could be immediately accretive. I'll now turn the call over to Mike Kanan, our Chief Financial Officer to discuss the particulars of the fourth quarter and 2017 in general."
1,"7 million incurred in connection with the change of the Matas CEO are included in the EBITA guidance. With that, I have concluded the run-through of the financial figures and I'll hand you over to Gregers for comments on the announced measures to enhance our short-term performance and our strategy update."
1,"7 million tons as well as continued strong pricing dynamics, which we expect will yield 2018 adjusted EBITDA of $89 million to $95 million. Our Real Estate strategy will continue to focus on unlocking the long-term value of our HBU portfolio. We currently have a strong pipeline of identified HBU opportunities as we look into 2018, including additional sales in our Wildlight development project."
1,"7 million, $1 million of which was the result of a lease termination payment. As we continue working to better align our expenses with our current enrollment in income levels, we are excited about the strategic initiatives we have discussed to this morning and we believe these efforts will serve to strengthen the finances and future of our university. With that, I will turn the call back to Dr."
1,"7 stars, 10,000 of those reviews came in the last year alone. Given these risks and the sheer size of the opportunity we face, our strategic plan is to be aggressive while always keeping the customer experience at the center of every decision we make. Opening markets quickly kicks up key network effects in inventory, marketing and brand but also generates additional execution and customer experience risk that we must be mindful of."
1,"7% and 24% for 2018. Please turn to slide 4 and I will summarize the key investments we have made in 2017 in accordance with our Vision 2025 strategic plan. As we have been reporting throughout the year, we undertook a very complex carve out of the Enovation Controls business from its prior operations."
1,7% as a result of leasing outcomes achieved and the acquisition of additional units in GWOF over the last 18 months. The positive market conditions and the continued execution of our strategy has seen the portfolio deliver outperformance in 2017 and be in an excellent position for 2018. The strong returns achieved have been underpinned by the high quality of our assets.
1,"7% one year ago. We have grown our free cash flow per unit and lowered our payout ratio while reducing our leverage and have enhanced our financial flexibility to execute on our strategic initiatives. During the fourth quarter, the trust successfully completed a public offering and private placements for total gross proceeds of CAD 113 million and issued 12."
1,"7% over vehicle production also was quite strong and included not only the positive trends we see in China, but also very strong growth in our Fluid, Fuel Tank and Delivery module business. Now, moving to slide 5, we continue to have increasing confidence in our strategy towards electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles. The level of enthusiasm in our interactions with our customers continued to remain quite strong."
1,"7% reported in the comparable quarter of 2016. The ratio for the fourth quarter does benefit from a lower provision for compensation expense, but reflects ongoing investments in technology and people in support of our strategic plans, as evidenced by the strong growth, most notably in the U. S."
1,"7%, down 130 basis points from last year, driven primarily by lower average unit retail and an environment that remained highly promotional throughout the year. Adjusted operating expense was down 2% from last year on higher sales, resulting in 410 basis points of expense leverage, while still supporting investments in our strategic initiatives. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $101 million compared to $3 million last year and net income per diluted share was $0."
1,"7%. We also strengthened our balance sheet by more than $900 million through debt pay down and pension contributions, as part of our deleveraging strategy. This was complemented by an improving top line with global brand volume growth of 1% and net sales per hectoliter growth of 2."
1,"75% we are sort of happy with as long as we can maintain a high quality profitable growth in the range that we have been delivering in the past. So that's our, so-called base case   baseline sort of way of dealing with the, with our strategy. So that's what."
1,"79. In conclusion, we will continue executing our strategic initiatives, completing construction on the paper machine converting lines and warehouse expansion in Shelby, and executing on our plan to reduce SG&A expense by $20 million over the next two years. While market conditions and our consumer business continue to be challenging, we believe we are investing in all the right areas to position ourselves for growth in operating cash flow, margin expansion and returns on invested capital."
1,"8 billion at the end of January. During the first quarter, we have taken major steps to our 2018 to 2022 strategic plan, on which we have choose the name Build A Sustainable Profitability. On November 30, we completed the sale of our incoming tour operator, Jonview, for an estimated selling price of CAD 48 million."
1,"8 billion, more or less to be shared by Spain and France. And of course, we will have to discount subsidies from that, so eventually it's more than â‚¬600 million to be paid in the next strategic plan. In the annex of the current document, we contemplate a new interconnection between the Peninsula and the Balearic Islands, and that would be a sizable investment exceeding most likely those â‚¬600 million we've mentioned."
1,"8 million of share repurchase, partially offset by operating cash flows. Our balance sheet continues to leave us extremely well-positioned to execute on our strategic plans. Our days sales outstanding on accounts receivable were 76 days at December 31, 2017, compared to 79 days at the end of 2016."
1,"8%. We also made significant progress on our strategic initiatives. In particular, I want to focus on a few key achievements."
1,"83 or more on a per share basis. Our long-term performance has been driven by our three-pronged strategy that starts with a focus on growing our business by winning with consumers. From there, we take our strong cash generation to reinvest behind brand building and use the remainder for strategic M&A."
1,"9 billion of that is Opps Xb, the next largest portion, I think $4 billion, $4. 5 billion is real estate related, debt fund, opportunistic, and income fund, and there is also reasonable amount of dry powder in our Special Situations Control Investment Strategy, it's still there, but I think across all the strategies where we are holding dry powder the determinant would be pace of investment opportunities. And in this environment, we've been very vocal about this where liquidity is ample, economies are growing reasonably well around the world, rates are relatively low up until recently, markets pretty low volatility, investors reasonably complacent."
1,"9 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As we have stated before, we anticipate R&D expense will increase in fiscal 2018 as we accelerate our whole-product solutions strategy investments, including advancing our TRANSCEND drug-coated balloon human clinical trial and other proprietary products, including preclinical work on below-the-knee and AV fistula drug-coated balloon projects. SG&A expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were 30."
1,"9 million year-over-year. One of our strategic priorities has been to grow our audience and Q4 represented Zynga's highest mobile average DAU in four years. This past quarter we significantly increased our mobile audience from 16 million average DAU in Q4 of 2016 to 20 million average DAU in Q4 2017, up 24% year-over-year."
1,"9%, due to robust market trends in both businesses, our continuing efforts to enhance our product and service offerings, and our best-in-class client service. Because we believe that the market trends will continue, and we will continue executing our successful go-to-market strategy, we are reaffirming our long-term goal of organic revenue growth in the low double-digit for the Manufacturing segment. Combining robust sales of the PTS family of products, core reagents, and microbial identification services, the Microbial Solutions business continued to generate low double-digit organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter and for the year."
1,"9%. I think this shows the strength of the Garanti machine, how we perform in line with our strategy, long-term sustainable strategy, as well as our transformation plan."
1,"9%. This revenue decrease resulted from our shift in strategy to focus on growing BioScrip's core revenue mix, including contract changes with UnitedHealthcare, which were completed as of September 30, 2017, and from the negative impact of the Cures Act. Our revenue mix in the fourth quarter was 75."
1,"91 at the end of the third quarter. Looking forward, we expect book value to stabilize around $14 per share as we complete the balance of the execution of the strategic plan and account for these one-time accounting charges such as those related to the preferred share redemptions I discussed. I want to reinforce that these accounting changes are not related to investment or operating performance, the preferred shares that we redeemed or issued at a discount and redeemed at par which gives rise to the one-time charges under GAAP reporting even though the redemptions are favorable to our common shareholders."
1,"A bit of a big question   big picture question from me. Over the years, we've seen different strategic initiatives and directions from Mittal. We had the aggressive and transformational growth through M&A."
1,"A couple of comments on that. First, I want to make clear that our strategy in the beverage business remains as it's been. It's focused on brand building, it's focused on innovation, and it's focused on execution in the marketplace funded by driving incremental productivity."
1,"A favorable market environment helped to significantly increase both revenue and earnings compared to 2016. Strong markets, combined with a disciplined focus on our strategic priorities, enabled us to strengthen and position our company for the future, faster than we had anticipated. We achieved adjusted EBITDA for the year of $2."
1,"A longer track record than any current S&P 500 company and we're well on our way to deliver over $5 billion of revenues in 2018. We're investing more than ever before in our organic business, growing our Strategy, Services and Innovation team to support new products and services, adding more quota bearing sales heads as our business grows, and supporting a broader initiative around customer experience. We continue to grow our global platform adding 19,000 cabinets across 23 projects in 2017 and have a very active constructive   construction pipeline going forward, with more than 9,800 customers."
1,"A lot of that work has been superseded by the offer from Sibanye-Stillwater. But we continue to find interest particularly because it's something that is a proper growing concern in our current strategy. That development project continues and, therefore, that's work in progress for that capital."
1,"A net loss of $1. 7 million from our investments in unconsolidated entities included in the strategic plan, and a charge of $1. 5 million from a valuation adjustment to a CRE loan held for sale also included in the strategic plan."
1,"A number of these accomplishments were strategic in nature and, we believe, have us well positioned for 2018 and beyond. Before I turn the call over to Tim, Greg, and Tyler, I want to discuss some of these strategic initiatives, which we think are important to our continued high performance as we become a larger bank. Our strategic planning process for 2018 has been comprehensive and collaborative."
1,A question about the discussions with Embraer. How much of the outcome of that strategic plan is coupled with completing the business case for NMA? Is that a large component of your thinking around a new airplane for 2024 or 2025?
1,"A. Development will remain our key strategy to create value for shareholders and our development activity remains very active with many new pre-leased projects either committed or under pursuit. As mentioned, this quarter, we added 20 CityPoint to the active pipeline; it's a 211,000 square foot mirror building to 10 CityPoint in Waltham, which we completed in 2016."
1,"About our product strategy, we actually adhere to value creation strategy. So our product strategy remains stable."
1,"Absolutely, the aftermarket initiative is alive and well. It's one of our strategic priorities and it continues on. This is in addition to all."
1,"Accordingly, as Denis will detail in his remarks, we are modestly reducing our adjusted EBITDA guidance range for fiscal 2018. We remain confident, however, in our ability to execute on our multi-lever growth strategy and create long-term value for our stockholders. After closing out fiscal 2017 by completing nine acquisitions in four months, during the first quarter, we acquired an additional six companies with total annual revenues of approximately $53 million."
1,"Acquisitions with strategic fit like Global Cash Card, WorkMarket and last year's acquisition of TMBC in the talent management space are just one way ADP is helping clients keep pace with change and manage the increasing demand for flexibility in the way people work and how organizations manage their talent. I am proud of our progress to date in our innovation-focused investment strategy to develop open and flexible solutions that can be adapted to meet the needs of any client. We believe that pursuing a healthy mix of acquisitions that align with our strategic priorities in combination with investments in organically-driven innovation is the right approach for us to deliver market-leading capabilities to clients that will foster sustainable growth."
1,Across the network we are focused on enhancing the overall customer experience. We will talk more about our aftermarket growth strategy throughout the year. Okay.
1,"Active share buybacks will continue after this first couple of quarters, where we're using some of that capital to finance the Liberty acquisition. So on a go-forward basis, very powerful franchise, continued active share repurchases as part of our strategic plan. And we're quite excited about being able to produce good results."
1,"Additionally, Applebee's has outperformed the CDR category over the same timeframe. While still in the early stages of our strategic initiatives, we're pleased with the change in trajectory that we've been able to achieve here. From my perspective, our recent performance can be attributed to a combination of variables and the execution of our strategic plan."
1,"Additionally, partners are expected to open two restaurants in 2018, one in Fort Wayne, Indiana in the second quarter and one in Markham, Ontario in the fourth quarter. The third component of our total return strategy is returning capital to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we demonstrated this through the return of $9."
1,"Additionally, through the first six months of fiscal year 2018, we've recorded revenue growth of 24% as reported and 22% in constant currency, with 11% of the 22% being organic, which is significantly above our long-term outlook of 4% to 6 % top line growth. As discussed previously, we continue to work internally on our annual update to our strategic plan and assessing the future impact of the Cook Pharmica acquisition on our long-term outlook. We anticipate being in a position to update our analysts and investors of any change to our long-term guidance on our Q3 FY 2018 earnings call."
1,"Additionally, we have filed all of the related documents as one 8-K, which is also available on the Investor Relations website. On this morning's call, we'll hear first from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain's President and CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress toward our strategic plan followed by Stuart Brown, our CFO, who will cover financial results and 2018 guidance. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A."
1,"Additionally, we recently added an interactive modeling section to our website where analysts and investors can easily download our historical financial statements to assist them in building financial models on our company. Given our success with this initiative in 2017, we are very optimistic about 2018 and playing to continue and even accelerate the building of awareness of our company and our strategic initiatives. We have targeted nearly double the number of investor conferences in 2018 versus what we attended in 2017, and believe exposures at these conferences will provide further opportunity, tell our story and provide meaningful dialog with potential investors."
1,"Additionally, we will benefit from lapping incremental freight costs related to last year's one-time inventory investment. These tailwinds, coupled with the fixed cost leverage built into our high-growth financial model, will enable us to deploy more dollars towards our strategic initiative in fiscal 2019. This year, we will continue to focus on preserving our competitive low prices, increasing our annual marketing spend from 2."
1,"Additionally, within the quarter, we had two more new customer wins in financial services that exceeded $1 million in TCV each. In addition to our success with new customers, we continue to progress with our land and expand strategy. Avery Dennison, a global leader in adhesive packaging technologies, started with less than 100 seats."
1,"After years of challenging charter markets characterized by heavy fleet supply growth and oil inventory overhang dampening demand, conditions are now in place for sustained upturn, and in fact, feels very similar to that stage of previous cycles. Meantime, we're continuing to execute on our strategy, and we're waiting for the spark to typically ignite to full recovery. And with that, we're now pleased to open up the call for questions."
1,"Again, a remarkable achievement that we're extremely proud of. So in summary, we'll continue to keep our eyes on the horizon for changing customer preferences and emerging trends and technology to ensure that we're supporting our key strategy of remaining relevant to consumers. And we'll continue to invest in that technology to improve the customer experience and support our culture of service excellence."
1,"Again, I think as Jim mentioned, you know, we're going to look at it, a lot of these acquisitions are closing over the year. Part of our strategy in 2017 was to free up some availability on the line of credit and we've also got some cash on hand. So, as we get closer to each of these acquisitions, you know, whatever is best for the long-term goals of the portfolio and shareholders, we'll opportunistically close those acquisitions with a mix of different financing solutions."
1,"Again, these are MAKE numbers, a CAGR of 8% to 9%, which drives the cost installed base and the continued penetration drives this market, but also new services. Our strategic priorities still remains, so more than 50% growth in revenue towards 2020 compared to 2016. And again, to generate best-in-class margin."
1,"Again, well not just now. Again, with the strategic plan, we will have the entire framework and we will be able to go into more detail when we present the new strategic plan."
1,"All in all for the group, we are the odd-percent up for the full year versus 2016, but it's not exactly where we'd like to be in terms of the long-term growth of our Service division. It did grow well in Food & Water, where we met our objectives well and we are up in both the year-on-year for the full year and on the quarter. That sequentially is a marginal issue, so all in all, we're happy with the outcome of that."
1,"All in all, 2018 is going to be a busy year. We're ambitious, we're committed, we're going to execute the key strategic initiatives I've described. We know there is significant growth ahead, and we are building this company for a long and bright future."
1,"All of us at Yum China, we are committed to building leading brands for the long-term through innovation in all aspects of our business. We will focus on our strategic priorities on digital and delivery while continuing to improve our food and in-store experience. While we finish 2017 with solid sales momentum, we continue to face challenges of the revitalization of Pizza Hut and lapping of two very successful Chinese New Year."
1,"All of which deepens the farmer, the agronomist and Origin's engagement overall with the customer proposition. We turn to the next slide then and just look at our strategic priorities and key focus points. Firstly in terms of scale, our priorities for capital development and a key pillar of our development is that buy-and-build farm services distribution both in our existing footprint and newer geographies to expand that service footprint where primary crop production is both competitive and efficient."
1,"All that should help grow revenues. On the expense side, we're maintaining efficiency and balancing strategic priorities by growing the customer base, elevating the brand, scaling our newer products and positioning the company for the long term. On a personal note, I'm really encouraged by what I've seen here at Ally in a short time."
1,"All these factors should help us to continue to post attractive results for our shareholders. We expect that our strategic priorities, which are deeply focused on digital transformation, will permit us to take greater advantage and gain market share during the better economic cycle that is quickly approaching. Thank you for listening."
1,"All-in-all, we are very pleased that the development of our business strategy is now driving stronger quarterly results and we're gratified to see that our breadth of choice for our clients is so closely aligned with and creating value for shareholders. And while we're happy to see our strategy playing out favorably in our numbers, we are also certainly cognizant that we have affected these changes in the context of a positive market environment. In addition to the impact of markets on our business, we note the impact that seasonal factors can have on our numbers and on a quarter-over-quarter basis."
1,"Allison serves a wide variety of end markets in various geographies. We have consistently articulated our strategic priorities of global market leadership expansion, emerging markets penetration, product development focused on value propositions that address the challenges of improved fuel economy and reduced greenhouse gases and core addressable markets growth, while delivering solid financial results to create value for our stockholders. Today, Allison remains focused on continuing to execute its strategic priorities as we find ourselves with more opportunities to drive innovation and growth than at any other time in our history."
1,"Along those lines, Rich, you've been an early and aggressive investor in blockchain technology, and you mentioned on your earnings call that you currently have a blockchain pilot going in the proxy business. Can you update us on your kind of long-term plans for blockchain, both in the proxy business and then, more broadly, what you also see in equity and fixed income trade processing?"
1,"Along with that, we are also driving a pretty robust digital transformation, taking all of that storytelling, taking our new creative and taking some of the personality and voice and tone that we want to be known for and reflect that across all our touch points. To kind of tie it altogether, right, marketing has a very disciplined strategic plan now where we have five imperatives that we are marching towards tie to the five imperatives Kevin talked about. Number one is driving thought leadership and transforming our brand, which is right along the lines you're talking about, and there are multiple aspects to that."
1,"Also joining us are Kenny Wyatt, our Chief Revenue Officer; and Tony Jamous, the President of Nexmo. Alan will discuss our strategy and fourth quarter and year-end results, and Dave will provide a more detailed view on our fourth quarter and full year financial results and our 2018 guidance. Slides that accompany today's discussion are available on the IR website."
1,"Also we are constantly evaluating new terminal options to minimize expense of trucking costs for our customers and we have new terminals in Canada, Oklahoma and the Bakken under review. As for our last mile strategy, our collaboration with Solaris continues to progress. Our sales teams are jointly coordinating opportunities in the Eagle Ford in anticipation of our new plant coming online this may."
1,"Also, there is no change. Of course, it's a strategy that we are following, which is working well, and I think we are quite well-positioned in all markets that we are working in. Basically, we work along two dimensions."
1,"Also, we expect incremental cash flow that will allow us to both continue our strategy of returning capital to our shareholders while maintaining appropriate leverage. In order to ensure that this is the case, we have been working on a comprehensive review of our cost base that we believe will generate additional margin improvement and SG&A benefits that should fund most of our long-term strategic initiatives and also help address the need for wage increases for our store associates to make sure we remain competitive in the labor market. Regarding our long-term strategic investments, in fiscal 2018 we are embarking on the implementation of a new inventory and supply chain platform, consisting of several modules that will be phased in over the next few years."
1,"Although the headwinds in gross profit and R&D that impact that adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2017 could have been delayed or spread over a longer period to improve short-term profitability, we elected not to do that. We remain convinced that our strategy to aggressively advance our technology will result in better profitability and generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. Our strategy to actively seek to apply our technology to challenging and groundbreaking customer projects, along with our commitment to expand our industry-leading working knowledge of binder jet printing equipment, materials and processes, is key to our continued market growth."
1,"Although we still need to sharpen competitiveness in the high-end segment. In emerging markets, we are fine tuning our brand and product strategy to fit the local markets. We will continue to pursue our strategy for Mobile business, strengthening our leading position and profitability in Latin America."
1,"Altogether, we invested $1 billion in sustaining capital to maintain our assets, which still provided significant free cash flow to return to shareholders and continue to grow our Retail business. Before I speak about our 2018 guidance and strategic priorities, I would like to touch on the outlook of our markets. The 2017-2018 crop year will mark yet another year of above-trend yields for global grains and oilseed production."
1,"And after adjusting for $0. 9 million in acquisition, integration and strategic planning expenses, which we did not include in our financial estimates, our SG&A expenses were in line with our financial estimates. Interest expense for the quarter was $6 million, down from $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016."
1,"And again, most importantly, it aligns the project once again with the commitments that it has made and allows it to move forward and fulfill the obligations that we have to the community in Brooklyn, the city and our stake partners. So, overall, we saw Pacific Park as that part of our ongoing transformation that allowed us to achieve our objectives in Greenland to achieve their objectives as well."
1,"And again, to emphasize, we are very clear that our work is not done and that there is more for us to do and more market share for us to gain. We remain laser-focused on continuing to execute our strategy, and we believe our best days are ahead of us. Thank you very much and happy to take any questions."
1,"And again, we don't have to repeat history. I think our value before strategy   our value before volume strategy, which is the global strategy, it applies in different ways, in different markets, even in different times. So, what we have seen in Mexico is that regardless of what has happened in the sense of depreciation and everything, our cash flows in Mexico are robust in dollar terms."
1,"And all of this makes me optimistic about the future. We've now embarked on my first strategic planning cycle, given all of the great strategic thinking going on, the keys for the leadership team will be to focus to prioritize and to execute. There are many good ideas and proposed initiatives in front of us, but of course, we can't do them all."
1,"And all those have more to do with business topics. And over the next few weeks when we have the new strategic plan presentation, we'll talk to you about our vision and about some value levers in order to generate revenues in new business environments, in new business areas that until now we were not able to cover. We also keep our advantage in efficiency and in cost of risk and   well, we undertook the measure with BMN maintaining the financial parameters within the targets that we have set ourselves."
1,"And also, at the same time, it's a great time when the market is shifting from guaranteed fixed income type of assets into more equity-driven wealth management products. That fits very well into our strategy of providing a holistic personalized asset allocation service to our wealth management business. So, it's a perfect timing for us as well."
1,"And also, I wanted to understand kind of level of support that they receive from us at the store support center to better formulate what I felt like our strategic focus areas needed to be in the company. So, it was through that assessment we developed our strategic plan. We had talked about in our last quarterly conference call, and that plan has built on really five strategic areas of focus in our company."
1,"And as a consequence, we expect to reduce our operating expenses in 2018. Transforming our business is required for our long-term sustainability and competitiveness and it's one of our key strategic priorities. The investment in our Core Banking Platforms is a critical enabler of this business transformation and we continue to strengthen the leadership capabilities on this program."
1,"And as a result, we're able to figure out what is the best thing to do and do without regard to what we said was the best thing to do last year. All right, we're lined behind the strategic plan. It's very guest-driven."
1,"And as also important driver for potential further cost reduction, it's everything we do in process automation, in natural language processing, but also some best like testing drones to improve and reduce the cost of maintenance of our mobile network and potentially helping our field technician through the use of its augmented reality. So you can see a lot that has been done, but there's still a lot that we can do and that's why we are quite confident that we can continue our current strategy of growing our revenue, decreasing our cost, and providing a slight growth of EBITDA that helps us to fund the â‚¬1 billion CapEx that we planned to invest in 2018. Perhaps now a few words on BICS because very often BICS is not that well-known, and I think the opportunity and also the opportunity of the TeleSign acquisition to highlight some elements on our international carrier service subsidiary."
1,"And as discussed earlier, we expect this to decline moderately over the coming 2 years. To conclude, our focus is on executing our Umpqua Next Gen strategy, improving financial results and generating solid returns for shareholders over time, including a healthy dividend. And with that we will now take your questions."
1,"And as far as the PFS is concerned, we have been addressing to the distressing the assets. We have a strong balance sheet to deal with that distress as well as to plan growth for the future, diversification growth or the strategic initiatives that the PFS may adopt, so, there is no problem or the advocacy of the capital to deal with any kind of future contingency in this factor or otherwise. So, I would thank all of you, and should you require any more clarifications, discussions, details, we are always available 24/7 and I know many of you have been talking to Gaurav and Dr."
1,"And as I said before, we wanted to be kind of automatic with the regulators so that it's an amount that's very comfortable as they look at the financial strength of the organization. However, we have other cash needs as well at the parent company and we still continue to evaluate our alternative strategy program in terms of making other investments that will provide growth and accretive return to the organization. So we have a goal, we have a methodology to achieve that goal and we continue to execute our strategies across all the various disciplines that we evaluate as we look to put the money to work."
1,"And as it relates to other subsidiaries, that option is always there. I am   I do believe that it's important for us for our strategy to do something, but do the right thing. So we do have a number of different options across all industries and sectors, and it's being patient and pulling the trigger when you feel like it's the right one."
1,"And as our third quarter outlook suggests, our expectations remain in line with our original guidance for the year. Our team continues to focus on increasing long-term shareholder value by executing against our strategic priorities in the areas of academic outcomes, student retention, curriculum innovation, and diversification. We believe that by executing well on these priorities, we will drive revenue and free cash flow growth over the long-term."
1,"And as the fastest growing opportunity set is that the resimercial intersection of living and working, we couldn't be better positioned with the depth of offer and range of price points and lifestyles starting with Muuto's new perspective and millennial appeal at the affordable luxury entry point, all the way up to HOLLY HUNT's timeless appeal at the premium luxury level. This broad capability is core to the strategic initiatives that drive us forward. These include targeting underpenetrated and emerging ancillary categories and markets for growth, expanding our reach into residential and decorator channels around the world, improving the profitability of our Office segment and leveraging technology to expand our market visibility and improve our efficiency."
1,"And as to your question of we looking at the target, I think similar to what happened under M2016, we've already begun the work to begin our M2022 strategy. And so, if our numbers come in to what we're guiding to this year, I think you can expect that in December of this year, we'll be communicating to the analyst and investor community what our targets are for M2022."
1,"And as we look into 2019, we're seeing a similar pull-through. But again, so many of our contracts are either cost of service, which requires long-term planning, or minimum volume commitment-backed contracts. That's really what's driving our forecast."
1,"And as we've mentioned previously, this impact is expected to continue for the next two quarters. Focusing on our segment results for a moment, Performance Foodservice continued to execute on their strategic initiatives and delivered strong top-line growth of 7. 5%, independent case growth of 6."
1,"And as you can see from our numbers, we finished the year with a bit over $38 million of net cash. At this point, our strategy is to pay it down."
1,"And as you have seen this morning, we'll also continue to invest in value-creating growth like the acquisition in Brazil. Ladies and gentlemen, these are the highlights before I give you my views on our strategy and its focus for the years to come, I hand over to Dieter Enkelmann for a deep dive into our results."
1,"And as you rightfully pointed out, people are extremely valuable in scarce resource. And when we think about managing the business, it's all about being super thoughtful and disciplined, like what are the key strategic priorities within the business and the brands that can drive the most value in aligning our best resources to go and execute and deliver on those opportunities. Anything we think about in terms of growth outside of our organic potential is always through the lens of having to achieve significant and compelling incremental value beyond what we see in our brands, and that's something we're really, really disciplined about."
1,"And as you would be aware from our announcement last week, we completed the sale of CHEP Recycled on the 14th of this month. Later in the presentation, I'll provide an update on the progress we have made against our strategic priorities. I'll now hand over to Nessa."
1,"And based on the forward curve, we see the potential to be in ethane recovery for a significant part of 2018 and beyond. Now, let me take a moment to discuss our balance sheet, cash flow and our strategic priorities for creating long-term unitholder value. Our balance sheet and financial flexibility remains strong."
1,"And certainly, that would include intermodal, but there's also a lot of merchandise business that's truck competitive. That's one of the great things about our franchise and our strategic plan is   we have a great geographic footprint, our strategic plan to pull business off the highway is underscored within this economic environment."
1,"And Classifieds continues to enjoy robust vibrancy and double-digit growth, with mobile and eBay Kleinanzeigen continuing to be stand-out performers. Now, taking a step back and putting Q4 in the context of the past two-and-a-half years, we've made great progress against our key strategic priorities to drive the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform while sharpening the eBay brand. This strategy is enabling us to transform the eBay experience and accelerate the growth of our business."
1,"And clearly, we're pleased with our performance this quarter. The top-line reflects the strength of our underlying markets and our continued success in executing our conversion strategy to the growth of our Pipe products as well as our solutions strategy to the growth of our Allied Products. We demonstrated our commitment to expanding our margins and we'll continue to focus on the fundamentals of our business and driving execution across all aspects of our operations, as we progress through the remainder of fiscal year 2018 and beyond."
1,"And does anything change with higher interest rates? If we do have higher interest rates, does anything change in terms of your investment strategy, like is $100 million per year still something that you would target in realized capital gains if we did have a meaningful..."
1,"And during the period, we continue to roll out our Oracle system, which is now substantially complete. We've also launched our 30x30 energy strategy where we're targeting a 30% reduction in energy usage over the next decade or so. And lastly, we're proud to be members of the 5% Club."
1,"And Faiz Karmally, our Chief Financial Officer, will follow with a review of our fourth quarter and full-year financial performance. Then I'll return to discuss our strategy and outlook going forward. I'm very pleased to report that we achieved record results in 2017."
1,"And finally, as it pertains to stock repurchases, we were not active during Q4. Over the coming months, we will be evaluating with our board, a share repurchase program, as we take into account our overall liquidity position and the capital required for both hurricane recovery, M&A and other strategic initiatives. On slide 12, I'll take you through our 2017 performance for each of our operations, starting with Cable & Wireless."
1,"And finally, our recent acquisition of UK-based eTech Solutions expands our international valuation-related footprint and is expected to support our progress relative to automating appraisal workflows. To close out the discussion of valuations, we are continuing to execute against our strategic plan, which focuses on building unique and integrated solutions that offer the potential to transform the way real estate assets are valued. As we said in the past, the opportunity to transform the valuation space will be a multiyear endeavor and represents a potentially significant long-term opportunity for CoreLogic."
1,"And finally, to New Zealand and Mature on slide 15. In New Zealand, our manage for value strategy is continuing to deliver. We've seen slightly higher profit margins which are being partly offset by lower experience profits, but a small impact on earnings of a weaker New Zealand dollar, but again, delivered a strong cost performance."
1,"And finally, we expect capital expenditures to range between $215 million and $235 million. Cooper will continue to execute on strategic priorities, including entering additional sales channels, making further inroads into global OE markets, introducing new products at a faster pace and other initiatives focused on driving growth, especially with respect to unit volume in the U. S."
1,"And finally, we'll be moving to one segment, no longer breaking out market group-level detail, in order to align our financial disclosures with the way we now manage the business. I'll close by saying, continued execution against our strategic plan is allowing us to strengthen the business and improve the underlying fundamentals of the company. We're maintaining our disciplined approach to balance investments that drive growth with improved profitability and we will continue to execute on our capital deployment strategy to maintain a strong balance sheet, return capital to shareholders, and create growth and scalability."
1,"And for investment managers, that bundle might often include fund accounting, fund administration, and transfer agency services, and again we'll move up the value chain with them with our clients. And in our product development strategy, we've taken and are taking bespoke solutions or products like Middle Office Outsourcing, and increasingly investing and turning those into component solutions that our clients can pick and choose from, and giving therefore our clients the ability to partner with us a lot more flexibly than they might have been able to previously. And again, because we've invested in the profitability every one of these products and component solutions, we're happy to start anywhere and we'll grow from there."
1,"And for the first time in five years, we start 2018 with a clean operating model. We remain focused on improving returns across our business lines, on managing costs, and on executing on our strategy. And I'm encouraged by the progress that I'm seeing."
1,"And for the quarter we delivered sales growth of over 30% in Appliances, positive comps of nearly 60% in Mattress, and positive comps of almost 40% in Furniture. These results reflect that our strategic plan to invest in Home is working and that customers are responding to our new product offerings. Although our women's, kids and men's apparel categories underperformed the company comp for the quarter, the ongoing improvements in these three apparel division contributed significantly to our 50 basis points of margin improvement in the fourth quarter."
1,And global capital markets also reported solid earnings reflecting its ability to deliver solutions and services to clients across our entire bank. Our results also reflect their strength and focus of our management team and improving operational efficiency by managing costs and reinvesting in strategic initiatives that drive growth. This quarter we achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio of 55% driven through a combination of strong revenue growth and a focus on our expenses.
1,"and globally. As a reminder, we've put in place a strategic plan over eight years ago when the impact of global easy monetary policies first became apparent. Our plan was two-fold."
1,"And going forward, we expect our overall R&D spending as a percentage of revenue to be relatively stable. While organic investment remains the primary engine for our growth, we continue to look for opportunities to partner with other industry players in investments that accelerate our life cycle value strategy and vertical content, as we demonstrated by the recent joint venture with Adient for seats, announced earlier this month. Consistent with prior years and given the seasonality of our business, as we look into the next quarter, we expect first quarter revenue to be the lowest of the year for revenue."
1,"And hopefully you're seeing the culmination of a strategy, which is a Power of Choice strategy, which had long been diesel, natural gas and hybrid, but with the addition of electrification, whereby we see the key is application-specific technologies for the end customer, and that they pull that through OEMs, who we have large partnerships with. So that and a variety of other strategic initiatives we've been doing are hopefully proving out via our market share. And we continue to meet the emissions challenges as we go around the world, which we think present some potential opportunity in the long-term."
1,"And how it is   and have a lower cost. And that's one of our objectives, but how we decide to use that whether that's used to try to consolidate the market or in some fashion I'm not assure. I mentioned also accelerating inflation, when inflation with labor and distribution costs are rising   rising it, 8% to 10% a year, that's just an added challenge that everybody who participates in the market has to face."
1,"And I am confident that the full board, the Strategic Review Committee, management and our advisors have the alignment, focus and team to do just that. Also, as I'm sure you'll understand, we are not able to comment further on this process, and we would ask that questions stay focused on our results and strategic plan. That's the end of my prepared remarks."
1,"And I did not believe that would be at the expense of being a valued ingredient to more WPP-led client opportunities. And I think we have to do both to win and that is our strategy. My prediction is over the next six months, we'll see even more of it because as these digital infrastructures now get up and running in a much more comprehensive way, I think there will be more and more pressure on clients to figure out the efficiencies and the effectiveness of bringing these capabilities together as opposed to building them independently."
1,"And I feel like I have a real view of the importance of a brand and what a powerful weapon and asset it can be, and frankly how it can be a problem if you're not watching it every day. And we actually have made the brand one of   we added a strategic pillar to our strategy focused on the brand. And we talk internally all the time that every one of my 15,000 colleagues and I all have to be stewards of the brand on a day-in and day-out basis."
1,"And I guess somewhat related, any specifics or generalities for that matter with respect to your M&A process and what you're seeing out there in general and what areas you might be looking? And then secondly, I'm curious how the guidance reduction impacts your relatively recently stated long-term plan. And then, I had one more follow-up."
1,"And I had a passionate belief that the international business represented a growth engine for the company that was yet untapped, and the management team also felt the same way. So they asked me to come in and develop a new strategic plan for the international business. We began to implement that new strategic plan in 2014."
1,"And I have every confidence in SCOR's business model. We firmly believe that in 2018, we'll continue to demonstrate the ability to successfully deliver on our strategic plan, Vision in Action. Thank you very much, and I'll hand now the floor to Ian for the Q&A session."
1,"And I know the thesis is that you can kind of leverage the same infrastructure in the data centers, and I think as DST that was strategically compelling for you. But, Bill, as you look at the business, do you see that healthcare segment as being strategically important for SS&C and SS&C's long-term plans?"
1,"And I look forward to continuing that tradition here in Asia by starting a new private equity fund after I retire, dedicated to that mission. Between now and then I will remain deeply dedicated to Sea's mission of strategic priorities. And post my retirement, I will always remain a close friend to Sea over the years to come."
1,"And I still believe that's true. We're only doing divestitures up to 10% or 12% of the revenue in this first wave, but you can look to Triumph to continue to look at every business as to whether it's returning weighted cost to capital, whether it fits with our strategy, whether the changing landscape is favorable to them or not, and for us to make adjustments."
1,"And I think as I talked to Scott about the role in CSI, I just saw this was a very unique and distinct opportunity. And the team has laid out a very compelling strategic plan and vision for the future that I thought was very exciting. There is tremendous opportunity for growth here through the building of this company and that was a key reason."
1,"And I think if you look at how we performed in the past, you should expect that we should be able to meet those objectives going forward. If we turn to the last slide in our five-year   in order to get the five-year aspirations, we have this five-year strategic plan in place. The plan is the new rolling five-year plan, which has been approved by our board this past December."
1,"And I think that comes back to our basic strategy. If you're going to take on operational real estates, in the same way we refer to in our hotels business, we have a lot more confidence when the underlying value of the real estate in terms of vacant position, value alternative use, et cetera, is obviously far higher in Central London than it is in the regions generally."
1,"And I think that will position us for better   not only better cost structure, but also better decision-making. I think, we've been hard at work trying to formulate our strategy, which you heard some of today, and I'd tell you that people responded very well to that. And I think we're locked and loaded and ready to go get it."
1,"And I think the good news is we've had very strong investment performance. And in my experience, over time, as we distance ourselves from some of the   from the past noise, one of our objectives is really going to be to turn those   that interest back into growth with those respective clients. So, I think it's about doing   it's about doing more on a strategic basis with our clients and focusing on really where our core competencies are in terms of where we can deliver value to those clients."
1,"And I think we're on the path to resolution, but I don't expect that to occur really in the first quarter. I expect, as we come into the second quarter, we'll get into a more virtuous space with each other, and this will be resolved, and we will build out a strategic plan going forward. At least that's what I hope we can find a path to deliver."
1,"And I will go into more detail as I progress through the presentation. If you think about our specialties strategy, our focus in terms of where we deploy our R&D resources and our 27 Ingredion Idea Labs throughout the world, it is really at the intersection of where the consumer trends come together with our unique and differentiated technology. And that's where we can find growth and where we have differentiation."
1,"And I would call oil and gas upstream a distant third. We used to be a much bigger player in that industry, but part of our strategy kind of some of that was purposeful, some of that we didn't have a choice because there was no business. But we've reformed and reoriented our portfolio around those two pieces I talked about."
1,"And I would like to stress again my commitment with the Gas Natural project, a commitment which you can see not only in robust results and a robust balance sheet, but also in the plans for the future. Plans for the future that we will specify in this new strategic plan and that I will be delighted to present personally in due time, and I will be delighted to answer all of your questions in due time."
1,"And I would summarize it as follows. Starting with the customer, our Marketing value growth strategy is driven by leveraging the number one global brand and our technically innovative differentiated fuels and lubricants and growth in our base markets and new markets as well as sectors resilient to the energy transition. And we've been reshaping Refining and Trading portfolio to focus on and enhance our large complex highly integrated and competitive sites in our three main hubs, our three main trading hubs of the Gulf Coast, Rotterdam and Singapore."
1,"And I would tell you that in all of those, our merchants are working very hard with both our private brand and our supply chain as well as with our wholesale brands, and we're on track. So exclusivity remains a very pivotal piece of our strategy, and we are on the path to grow it to 40%."
1,"And if I could also ask, I understand you don't give guidance, but can you talk at all about what kind of tax rate you anticipate for 2018 given reform and how you're thinking about your tax reform savings? Could we see some reinvestment behind strategic initiatives? And if so, how much and more specifically where?"
1,"And if you look at the overall market that has a growth of a little more than two, it is obviously clear that we are gaining some significant market shares during 2017. When we started this year, we were clear about some of the investments we're about to make and the strategic plan for that. So   and that, I think, is also seen when we're coming in with our profit for the year."
1,"And I'll do it again. So, looking at the 2017 highlights, we promised you to do two things in 2017 that was basically reducing our leverage and getting on with a strategic plan which we have delivered. We have also started to start stabilizing our business and strengthening our balance sheet and getting on with rationalizing our portfolio."
1,"And I'm sorry   yeah, no, that makes a ton of sense. Just on the first part that Bruce was speaking to, I guess I just want to sort of again bring this back to, did you feel as though this was required from a competitive standpoint or was this really Humana's got this long-term plan and now we've got a great opportunity to really accelerate that while still taking care of our employees?"
1,"And importantly, every one of these boxes is effectively an annuity for the next 15 years as new records stay with us on average for that length of time. We also made significant progress on the execution of our strategic plan. As you will recall, our plan is focused on extending our durable business model through continued nurturing of our core developed markets, expanding into faster-growing emerging markets, and growing our storage-related adjacent businesses, such as art and entertainment services as well as data centers."
1,"And importantly, these appoints will enable me to dedicate greater degree of focus on the strategic direction and future growth opportunities of the group as a whole. Our continued investment in and development of our people is critical to us delivering on our strategic priorities and delivering a multi-platform engagement strategy across digital, outdoor, and sport media in all markets. Unlocking the value of digital across our portfolio is our focus today and tomorrow."
1,"And importantly, we've been able to achieve this improved leverage while continuing to strengthen our organization by investing in new talent and technology to enhance relationship management and client acquisition. Looking back on 2017, we consider it to be a productive year in executing on our strategic plan to enhance the value of our franchise. Through the continuation of our disciplined to M&A strategy and investment in our organic business development capabilities, we doubled the size of the company, extended our footprint into the Central Coast of California, and increased our presence in the Los Angeles market."
1,"And in China, we expand that judiciously in looking at how we can leverage our brand and distribution in new categories that really fit. So, that's been our strategy. I don't see any change in that capital allocation strategy or acquisition strategy going forward other than to reinforce we'll be very disciplined and any acquisitions we do will be very strategic."
1,"And in every one of those cases, they are going to be able to enhance our portfolio into the Water segment. If you follow Granite's strategic plan and diversification strategy over the last several years, we've made it clear that we believe the water and wastewater infrastructure industry is one of the large platforms of growth going forward. The Inliner business with the rehabilitation of pipes is a right market for expansion and teaming with our Kenny Underground division, will be a heck of an opportunity for us."
1,"And in fact, a big initiative of ours is we're trying to pick the custom jobs that we do very, very carefully, wisely in order to pick them in markets that are going to grow and then resell the basic   hopefully, the whole platform, but at least some of the basic sub-elements of it. Our strategy for 50 years is we do fixed price contracts, we own the IP from the contracts, and the way we really make more money over time is to replicate these custom jobs, so turn them into standard products. We've done that very successfully in the tire testing business, for example, which goes back now over 20 years."
1,"And in many cases, we're the only constant at the facility level, so as we work with those new operators, the terms and conditions change, the pricing, the service levels, the credit terms, et cetera. So overall, really not much to report by way of changes in DSO other than the fact that number one it continues to be really not a great standalone metric as to how we are as far as the success that we're seeing in executing our credit and collection strategy. And number two, then more specifically on the overall credit and collection strategy, we remain laser focused and really micromanaging each nickel and dime down to the facility level, never mind the customer level, much less even a rolled up overall DSO data point."
1,"And in reshaping all of that in terms of Clean Power and Nuclear and divesting the thermal business, which was always a plan, so, one thing I didn't mention was that we're very disappointed with the thermal results as we neared completion of the last remaining project, but I mean we didn't bid a single thermal project in 2017. So, it was our long-term plan. And I now believe we're in a position where lining up with the segments that we started 2018 in the 1st of January, we now have the sectors I think that have great customers, have great opportunities for growth also have differentiated services that ultimately can achieve higher margins within that sector."
1,"And in terms of share of the different activities and yes, we've got our systems growing faster and then the other one is growing not that fast, having some ups and downs, but we are more or less where we want to be. So the first driver today is the impact of what we did in the first year, which is to   which is the complete renewal of our platforms which are bringing competitiveness to our product so that I can confirm and I confirm that the results that we see are in line with our expectations, which allow us to confirm, as I said, our objectives for 2020, which means that we are confident on this segment driver, or segment engine to the margin extension, which is not only the mix, which was achieved more happily, but also the cost-cutting initiatives and the competitiveness of our platform. In terms of transaction   translation impact, I guess, you mean   maybe Marie-JosÃ© can say a word."
1,"And in the first quarter of this year, we took another step forward with the reintroduction of a new and improved Jackpot Party Social Casino app. This enhanced player-engaging version is evidence of our strategy of continued focus on providing the best player experience. And that leads me to our most exciting accomplishment, which is the completion of the NYX acquisition on January 5."
1,"And in the Middle East, we continued activities on the RasGas FEED for a major offshore development in the Arabian Gulf. Additionally, I'd like to highlight progress on two other strategic initiatives. Firstly, our Digital Twin project delivery is progressing well and our industry-leading project lifecycle management platform is starting to be developed on live projects, including the recently awarded Maersk Tyra Redevelopment Project."
1,"And in the third, it was some show on another network that had a bunch of dragons in it. Our strategy of premiering a new show each month is driving consistent and steady growth, and that's continuing here in the first quarter. Last month, we launched the new hit drama called The Chi, which had our most watched series premiere since the debut of Billions two years ago and has gained terrific momentum since."
1,"And in Windows, we significantly improved our operating performance at our Milgard Windows business unit. In addition to our segment performance, we executed against our capital allocation strategy by investing in our business, committing significant capital to two acquisitions, repurchasing approximately $331 million of our shares, and increasing our dividend for the fourth year in a row. As we turn to 2018, the fundamentals of our business remain strong and consumer confidence continues to improve due in part to the recently enacted tax reform."
1,"And it also comes down to our ability to actually embed these. Now there's a big part of how we build our strategy around these. And I think our incumbency, while I think it helps our clients and it helps us embed those technologies, it helps inform our strategy, because incumbency gives us insight to how they think about some of these new technologies."
1,"And it sounds like especially the new product innovation has gone very well this fiscal year. I was wondering if maybe you could perhaps add a little more color to what sort of strategic initiatives you might be doing with the product people, the R&D people that kind of drive that forward? And is there any sort of set goal that you're trying to strive to have your VA sales   a certain percentage of them being new product sales?"
1,"And it's also a number of company   another company now has filed for Chapter 11 in December, which is another sign that the players who do not develop a business in the way that we try to do, they are suffering the pain and   and pain in Spain, meaning that they are getting basically out of business. But we continue to drive our strategy and investing in security solutions and technology and that pays off and allows us to grow faster than the market in average in Spain and Portugal, so very encouraging to see that. Also good growth in most of the countries in Latin America, a bit of a struggle in Argentina where we have a negative net change in our portfolio and also less inflation in the price increases because of lower inflation rates in Argentina."
1,"And it's important to note that one of the reasons that we're able to do this is that we've chosen to curtail the amount of content that we license into third party D2C experiences. That's a decision that we made when Bob rolled out his strategic plan last year. And although that's had some short-term pain for us, because unlike some of our competitors, we've not been able to get the short-term revenue kick from licensing to third party SVOD."
1,"And last year, as part of our Asia-Pacific technical center opening, we opened our flagship training center in China, which we're quite proud of. And then, finally, on the customer engagement side, and you've got a little flavor of that from that video, we continue to use our motorsports relationships as our part of our customer intimacy strategy. So whether it's NASCAR, F1, MotoGP or Snocross, we get to give our customers a sense of what our refinish paint looks like as we put it into action."
1,"And lastly, we seek to gain a better understanding of the changing customer expectations for products and services in order to meet these expectations in a way that matches our overall risk profile. We remain confident in our strategy and in our ability to overcome obstacles and in our people that are working hard to execute our plans. We feel that the performance of the organization reflects our focus on shareholder value, and at the same time our commitment to being a strong community partner in the areas we serve."
1,"And let me say, Repsol is ready to tackle the future and the divestment of Gas Natural will accelerate our transition. Our company has complete not only any strategic plan. We have completed transformation, a transformation that has seen us lower our free cash flow breakeven to $40 a barrel, or more importantly, deliver our cash flow breakeven of $50 a barrel while being able to cover in full our dividend payments or strip buybacks from organic cash flow from 2018 onwards, a transformation that has seen us more than half capital investment while maintaining Upstream volumes and reserves and without compromising Downstream maintenance program."
1,And maybe to just help get a little more clarity on what is the strategy since we are acquiring so many products. How does all of this fit together and what is our portfolio strategy. Maybe I will ask Darren to kind of spend a couple of minutes to explain that.
1,"And now moving on to our auxiliary products sector. Our auxiliary product sector, led by our fuel cell compressor system remains a key focus area and an important part of our strategy. We have put considerable effect into redesigning our motor and controller to be more cost effective for this market, and this has resulted in follow-on wins in China for fuel cell applications."
1,"And now that we are a year into our transformation, the task appears more manageable. Our objectives in 2018 are similar to 2017. First, deliver incremental EBITDA dollars despite sales declines through operational improvements, portfolio and mixed management, and targeted growth initiatives."
1,"And now, a word about our capital allocation. Our capital allocation strategy includes a comprehensive approach to balance investing in long-term growth while providing strong returns to our stockholders. We typically target maintenance CapEx of between 1% and 2% of net sales."
1,"And now, what I would tell you is the company is agnostic as to where the value-creation opportunities come from, whether it's the consumer sector or others. We will continue to canvas the market for targets that advance our strategic priorities and allow us to create value for shareholders."
1,"And obviously, we are disappointed to four ourselves in this situation. We will address these matters in more detail at a later date and plan to keep the Q&A portion of today's call focused on our financial results and our strategy. Now, turning to the quarter."
1,"And of course, we will also include a model for international expansion of Aena. Another piece of the strategic plan will also be the dividend policy that will be part of the strategic plan to be approved in the next few months. Well, I would also like to refer to one of the key issues that we've been working on in the last few months, which is Barcelona Airport Master Plan."
1,"And of course, we will continue to use to offer different shopping formats, including combined supermarkets and pharmacies and standalone pharmacies. Given the online channel's importance to our overall omni-channel strategy, Bob will take you through Albertsons' recent e-commerce initiatives in a bit more detail on the next slide. Bob?"
1,"And on insulin pricing, we see this as a new market dynamic, so there'll be a continued pressure on pricing. This is what we have baked in in our guidance for 2018 and also long-term planned financial targets. I think it's too early to speculate whether there is an intuit, we have seen that in the fast-acting category that the rebate levels bottoms out at a point of time, but I think the basal dynamics is slightly different."
1,"And on slide 24, just to conclude, we are confident in future growth based on the demographic drivers of the sector, our portfolio of services and competitive positioning which provides diversification across the value chain and geographically. Diagnostics will continue to play an important part of our growth strategy and our international diversification is on track. We remain vigilant in respect of cost management and operational efficiency."
1,"And one factor in that was a lot of the changes we made in our promotional strategy, obviously, had a bigger impact in the second and third quarter. And then in markets, for example, like France, we saw our promotional strategy to embed   started to embed coming out of the third quarter, we got the full benefit of that with our retailers in Q4. So it's been really about executing our focus on our pack strategy."
1,"And one last thing I'd add is that actually the deal with Cars [Cars. com] gives us an extra year to grow our non-cars revenue, so that at the end of 2019, we're much more fully stood up with our total auto strategy and revenue package."
1,"And one of the things we're cautious about is it's a funny word, diworsification, right? And so, you can pursue sort of the Eagle-gratifying strategic initiative and then, take all of management's attention, which is usually what it requires and focus on what you've acquired. And then, you've taken your eye off the ball of the business that creates all the value."
1,"And Orange Money is also a very great success, with more than 37 million customer at the end of this year. So, we are very confident to beat our target regarding our strategic plan by the end of 2018, that was to reach â‚¬400 million revenues."
1,"And other than Bon-Ton which   we do have Bon-Ton in Columbus, they're also in about 250,000 square feet in Chicago. But that was also a distribution location that they mentioned in the 8-K they filed that they plan on keeping as part of their strategic plan. So, we don't think anything's imminent there."
1,"And our growth strategy there is not tied to an auto build number. Our growth strategy is all around growing our content per vehicle in such a way that we can outgrow the underlying market by 3 to 4 percentage points. So, if you believe the forecasts that global auto builds this year are going to be up 1% to 2%, we said we expect our Auto business to be up in that 4% to 5% range."
1,"And our intention is to gradually   as we generate the deposit growth, that we would be reducing our reliance on those areas and having more of a core franchise continuing to experiment, continuing to combine digital banking, electronic banking services, and   to our private banking offerings. And that is our strategic plan to improve the quality and value of our franchise."
1,"And our mid-term financial targets, there are no changes and then towards financial and strategic targets in 2018. This year, we are proceeding with our long-term strategic plan by expanding SilmÃ¤asema's network and by developing operations. We are also in the process of starting a significant development program that involves changes to operating models and step-by-step renewal of information systems over the next couple of years."
1,"And our net leverage ratio declined by a full turn and now stands at the midpoint of our targeted long-term range of 2 to 3 times. In addition to our team's incredible efforts in responding to one of the most active storm seasons in recent history, we had several other notable accomplishments during the year that were important to executing on our Powering Ahead strategy. We once again grew the residential standby market with new products and programs along with expanding our dealer base and retail shelf placement, all with a longer term goal in mind of increasing the awareness, availability and affordability of home standby generators."
1,"And over the last several years, Air Canada has made significant progress towards its goal to be a sustainable global industry leader. Our strategy has been to selectively and profitably expand our international services by leveraging our improved cost structure and our competitive advantages and concurrently significantly reduce our overall risk profile of the company. The results so far have been very encouraging."
1,"And perhaps, even more important, we have a leadership team in place that is focused on intensive teamwork and on collectively delivering result in both the short and the longer term. So, in conclusion, I have been in the CEO seat for over two years and I'm confident on our strategy to build-out a unique set of capabilities will allow us to compete at the highest levels to address the needs of our surgeons and the clinical and economics dynamics of this marketplace. The combination of our cutting-edge implant portfolio, our leadership in MIS, especially in lateral; the newly introduced Surgical Intelligence Platform; and a robust services business moves us even farther on our path to having a fully integrated procedural offering and positions us to execute well in this evolving healthcare environment."
1,"And second, entering a lease for a new headquarters nearby our current location, providing a major upgrade to the working environment for over 800 Guidewire and Cyence professionals who'll be able to move in next year. I'm also grateful that Richard has agreed to lead our strategy function as Chief Strategy Officer. An important mandate given the increasing and diverse growth opportunities the Guidewire has today as we build the true industry platform."
1,"And second, we closed an integrated three Cable acquisitions, InterLinx Tonaquint Networks, K2 Communications and Crestview Communications increasing our total connections by 4%. Looking ahead to 2018, slide 22, our objective build on the strategic priorities we have already put into place to grow revenue, improve the customer experience and increase our operational effectiveness. We are planning on more fiber expansion within our existing IPTV markets and may add additional markets to that list."
1,"And second, we closed and integrated three cable acquisitions, InterLinx's Tonaquint Networks, K2 Communications, and Crestview Communications, increasing our total connections by 4%. Looking ahead to 2018, slide 22, our objective build and strategic priorities we have already put into place to grow revenue, improve the customer experience, and increase our operational effectiveness. We are planning on more fiber expansion within our existing IPTV markets and may add additional markets to that list."
1,"And sir, by the way, this year the production is quite high and next year expected if everything goes well, and if the monsoon is going to be good, then the production of next year will be even better than this year. So, is there any long-term plan the government is taking so that this type of fall is not going to happen again next year?"
1,"And so I would say that pretty much every retailer we sell to does private label, and so there is that inherent discussion as to what are they trying to do with their brand and their overall category strategy, and then how do we fit with our brands and what we can bring from an innovation standpoint. And that's the challenge that our customer teams have every day is just putting together a strategic plan with our key accounts that drive the business over the next two or three years."
1,"And so maybe what we may have expected at one point in time there regarding revenue trajectory may be a little different now. But again, no meaningful change to the underlying exposure, nor to our hedging strategy, or the length of time that we're going out."
1,"And so we absolutely expect to continue our long-term track record of market share gains. To fortify our place as a leader in the industry, in 2018, we're fueling a number of strategic initiatives to capture key growth opportunities to complement our existing strength in creatively led agencies. We're continuing to scale our data at the center platform Zero & One as a resource to our partners, as they address the CMO's toughest business challenges, which increasingly revolve around better understanding and communicating with their customers."
1,"And so we are ready to develop other airport operation and extracting the value from this activity in the years to come. The strategic plan will decide on how to do international expansion and the geographic areas to be covered, and this will be part of our   a pillar of the strategic plan to be approved in the next few months. So the details on how we do international expansion will be part of the strategic plan, but the decision to go for additional international expansion is a conclusion that we have already reached."
1,"And so we think that this is   we haven't talked a lot about. This is part of our Lead Gas initiatives and strategy, and you're going to hear more about that going forward. But the terms distributed generation, demand response, these are terms that, in particular, have always kind of centered on the commercial and industrial part of the market, and they've kind of come in, in and out of favor based on where gas prices are and utility prices are."
1,"And so, at this point, as we do the math, refinancing those significantly prior to their due date, if you will, it hasn't been advantageous. However, we will continue to analyze that just like we do with our capital structure all the time, as we look forward and make sure that we got the position   or the company positioned right to support our strategic initiatives."
1,"And so, I wouldn't take this to mean that we're going to now build long haul takeaway pipeline. That's not our strategy but we certainly see significant demand in the Bakken for gas processing. The gas-oil ratio has continued to widen."
1,"And so, I'd welcome the opportunity to hear your latest thoughts. But importantly, as you look out to 2018, your key operating and strategic priorities?"
1,"And so, I'll try to answer that through these slides and if I don't, let's come back to it. We really feel like it varies by market and by our go-to market strategy, depending on who that sales partner is."
1,"And so, we want to make it as easy as possible when someone gets a requisition for our services that they get it done. So that's important for our consumer strategy. And then the other element of consumer strategy is we've actually launched direct access testing options in a handful of states where it's fully permitted."
1,"And so, when you think about it that's a lot of, a lot of content that we can monetize in multiple ways and create these brands and stand them up and possibly bring direct to consumer if we want to. So that's how we think of our content strategy."
1,"And Steve, maybe I'll add just to that would be that you see the company continue to operate with discipline and extreme focus around each of our strategic initiatives. All that encompass our vision of achieving the 2020 and beyond."
1,"And structurally in our industry, I think we had to deal with 15 million vehicles that have been in our cohort, age cohort of 6 to 11 years, so no doubt that's been a factor. I think me coming into the company new with our leadership team at the company, we want to be a bit more introspective and focus on the things that we can control operationally and that's drove the emphasis early on, Michael, in terms of our strategic plan. That's really focused on what are the things that we can control to deliver the best experience in store and translate that into growth in any environment whether we're getting help from Mother Nature or not."
1,"And thank you to everyone for joining us today. I would like to start by updating you on the latest developments of the strategic plan that we first introduced on the Q3 earnings call. As it's evolved, this plan now consists of five key components."
1,And thanks again all for your interest in TPIC. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress toward our strategy of diversified global growth. Thanks again.
1,"And that brings us to approximately Â£130 million of property assets on the balance sheet. Notwithstanding this, our strategy remains to pursue a predominantly capital-light approach to growing our network, and we do expect at some point to move these properties off of our balance sheet. As we said in today's results release, we finished the year strongly in terms of growth with 118 openings in the fourth quarter alone."
1,"And that is also a comfortable situation for 2018. If I move to the question number two, which is if we will do M&A operations in Iberia, well, what we say is we repeat our long-term strategy. We always said that we think that the Spanish market is a market which is not yet consolidated, is quite fragmented, and we want to be one of the main actors of this consolidation process and of course, we will look at opportunities."
1,"And that is in the other side of the mine, we can connect the infrastructure to the existing infrastructure. So the plan   the overall plan, long-term plan remains the same. We are developing the new zones as we are finding them."
1,"And that joint venture has not been approved yet, but we are anticipating all going well that to happen sometime in the first half of the year. And then as Clive mentioned, we have quite a bit of investment at the center as well to drive the strategic initiatives. We have added capability around some functional areas of focus, procurement, HR, technology."
1,"And that will exclude the impact of Yakult transaction that was announced two days ago. 2018 will be a year of execution and delivery behind our three strategic priorities of accelerating growth, maximizing efficiency and allocating capital with discipline to make sure that we are moving safely towards our 2020 ambition. I will close there and we can open the floor for questions."
1,"And that's an evolution that we think will continue. And that's very much also a part of our strategy to take advantage of that evolution and make sure that we stay at the forefront of that evolution so that we continue to create more value for clients, candidates as well as for our employees."
1,"And that's not only the services from Pointnext, but that's the Financial Services capability. So it is a key piece of our strategy. And as long as the business continues to perform and customers are looking for that flexible consumption, we like that business."
1,"And that's really what happened here. So while we had a long-term plan or discussion about where to go with the company in terms of bench strength, about adding technology value, really the timing of this past quarter was driven by those signs that we needed to put in place strong governance capabilities that would protect against loss. And that's really what resulted in the timing occurring at the end of this year."
1,And that's something that we're excited about at Tyson as we think about our differentiated model for performance improvement through financial fitness. So the next part of our strategy I want to dive into is sustainability. So let me explain what that means to us.
1,"And that's what we've delivered through each generation of our product development process. Now, as I said, our go-to market strategy is different than the competition. We focus primarily on the patients in the U."
1,"And the other thing we've done is we've tied that to a heavy check. We've talked about long-term planning tools and taking a very efficient approach to this, so that we only touch the aircraft once. So one of the aircraft is in the shop at the moment, there is some certification work that we're going through, and we want to make sure that we have the quality of the product right."
1,"And the second message is a message of transformation. We will present a strategic plan in which we will try to show challenging targets, which will aim at transforming the company to adapted   to an industry, which makes this necessary with   and the company has a will to do so and a clear goal of generating value for shareholders. And the third goal or message is, well, asking for some patience for some time."
1,"And then a heightened demand in Europe, where it's important to source some local talent and people who speak local languages, et cetera. Both of these are   I don't want to call them one-time effects, but they are somewhat temporary in nature and there's really no deviation in our longer-term strategy and intention, which is to leverage a really robust community of capable SI partners. But the combined effects of heightened demand in Europe and the overall cloud transition has led to increased utilization and increased aggregate demand for Guidewire services."
1,"And then as a result, we did deliver on our commitments financially in 2017, we exceeded our sales   our revenue number, exceeded the operating profit. We're fortunate enough to exceed the EPS and we're able to raise our EPS target throughout the course of the year, generated free cash flow that we had talked about and then perhaps most importantly, or as important, is we really implemented the key elements of our disciplined capital allocation strategy and that really starts with the free cash flow from the businesses that we have plus the businesses that we disposed. And the first step was to restructure our balance sheet, to obtain the optimal capital structure."
1,"And then finally it's worth noting that moving into the second half of financial year, we saw overlapping tougher growth comparisons from the prior year especially in Europe and Australia. With that I'll hand it back to Alistair, who will update you on our strategic priorities and progress before we take any of your questions."
1,"And then finally, for acquisition, we have a robust pipeline of acquisition targets that align very well with our strategy overall. And we expect to continue to look for acquisition that's in line with our strategy to continue our growth model in Asia Pacific. Okay."
1,"And then just can I clarify one other thing. I think if I heard you right, you've said at various points that you thought that the tax reform will ultimately be accretive to the long-term plan. And I think you said that you have about 4%   you anticipate having about 4% headroom and that each percentage point would give you capacity for another $400 million of investment."
1,"And then just the last to maybe Barry, if you want to talk a little bit about the demand environment which you're seeing from customers and maybe some of the unique opportunities that you have an opportunity to go after   I see you guys, it's in your back door there, Arizona has a Medicaid RFP that should be coming out soon, it looks like you guys are one of the only new bidders to that, that are on the bidders' list. So curious what's interesting about that population to you in fitting well with your strategy?"
1,"And then just two quick ones, 2018 exports higher than 2017 exports, is that the way to think about it? And then the final one is, your maintenance CapEx per ton, long-term planning purposes, I think increased a little bit from the last quarter. Maybe if you could just talk about those two and then I'll hang up."
1,"And then just very briefly on OEM, I'll give you headline and ask Mark to jump in. So the way to think about OEM, it is one of our strategic initiatives within the organization. We work very closely with device manufacturers in the Orient."
1,"And then lastly, we've   our board has decided to make quite a few governance changes too, and again to support that growth and getting to the next level around changing some board members and augmenting kind of the governance structure of the company to make sure we're supporting it the right way to get to that growth. So it's a real exciting time, lots of interesting things going on, and we think that five-point plan, we've made a lot of progress on a lot of this since our Q3 earnings call a couple months ago, where we basically had announced a new investment from Silver Lake and LinkedIn to really support this new strategic plan and we are ahead on most of the dimensions with respect to where we thought we would be here a couple months later."
1,"And then the third phase for us would be driving deep and penetration to every Android platform, every Android handset manufacturers as well as our lead customers. And that kind of completes our strategy to really saturate the handset market. What comes after that and what we already started is looking at the automotive."
1,"And then thirdly, I can come back on exchange. So, in terms of   yes, I mean, the key part of our strategy is clearly as we explained to remove or reposition some of the non-luxury elements within our distribution. And clearly that goes hand-in-hand with our own retail network and what we do with promotions in our own retail network."
1,"And then, in the North region, in particular, it was considerably different than the rest of the country. And I would say the rest of the country has been in line with our kind of guidance and our objectives for the year. So we hate to talk about weather, but this was just a notable pattern regionally in our store profile."
1,"And then, nothing else, hopefully, this was a walk   a helpful walk through to highlight these assets as we begin to work on enhancing them to create incremental value, with the ultimate goal of getting that enhanced value to flow into our share price or taking advantage of the situation if it does not. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Chad, who's going to discuss our marketing strategy."
1,"And then, switching gears a little bit towards the cycle or macro dynamics. In terms of your business planning and strategy, we obviously have a pretty volatile macroeconomic environment that we're looking at right now and potential trade regulation or restriction that might come into play. Who knows what's going to go on with CAFE?"
1,"And then, we have other strategies that will contribute as well. Like our footprint management and restructuring strategic plan that we laid out at the same time. We're halfway through that journey as well and we've restructured and we are well on track to the returns and the income improvement that we expect from that."
1,"And there are a number of opportunities for us to improve execution in 2018. Moving on, our fourth strategic initiative is advancing our pipeline. While 2017 was a year for laying the foundation for transformation, 2018 is the year for execution and at the heart of that is our pipeline."
1,"And there, we also will let's say look more, as I said, in the Nordics. We will continue to look opportunistically in all markets based on our sector strategy. But the base of that work in the coming years, we will definitely select some new winners where we'll be long-term shareholders of."
1,"And there's   we're seeing a very rapid pace of innovation across all markets. And for us, as we sat down and we thought about strategic priorities for the business for the long term, it was very obvious that this is an area that we needed to focus on. And not only focus on, but really put a structure and a plan and execution around to make sure that we are as smart as we can be and make the   develop the best plans, make the best decisions, and then go and execute that, and deliver on these potential avenues of value across all of our brands."
1,"And there's nothing quite like feedback from a millennial. But it is exactly the focus and on what we're seeking to do at Meggitt, accelerating the delivery of our strategy to unlock this sooner. And on that note, I'd now like to invite your questions, and as always, if you could wait for the microphone, I think, they're in the room and state your name and the organization you represent, please."
1,"And these relationships with food companies and other players in the health and wellness space will help us make sure that we are pursuing the right products, with the right frameworks around the right products. So, I see the potential here is not only around our existing pipeline, but what other things could we and should we be doing that are aligned with our vision and our strategy on how we deploy food   gene editing in the food system. So, this is something that we hopefully be hearing more about over the course of next year."
1,"And these targeted verticals that we're investing in are areas that allow us to manage our intellectual property for the future, create value both in terms of instantaneous products for our customers but also lifecycle value. And all of that is balanced against our cash deployment strategy on where we want to invest. And we still see ourselves as primarily an organic growth machine with a tremendous marketplace, and our organic investment capacity is strong."
1,"And this strategy as far as this kind of combination between icons and new products is not going to be changed. In terms of price effects, our strategy as far as prices didn't change and in my opinion going forward won't change. What I mean is that we historically practice year-on-year, what we define inflation recovery strategy meaning that a price increase for comparable products between 2% and 3% is what we continue to apply in our collections."
1,"And this was frequently asked in the past that is about   although we haven't really specifically decided how to call it. But that is about the conference for the next term of strategic plan. And this will be planned at May 22, one month after the financial results announcement."
1,"And those sales would have definitely be diluted or dilutive to the equity of our brand, and that's why we didn't go after those sales. Along the way, we're continuing our strategy to get closer to our clients and opened commercial subsidiaries in several different countries, where before we were leveraging the relationship with the distributor. We recently did in Southeast Asia and in Latin America."
1,"And throughout the year, we realized $28 million of operational cost savings. As our people are central to our strategy and success, we launched an extensive talent management review and development initiative which will be continually ongoing. As we look ahead, we will continue to streamline and standardize processes, focus on engineering productivity improvement, invest in our specialized solutions sales organization, and in our key account management."
1,"And to some degree we're reaching into the security budget, as well as the networking budget as we deliver NSX and we see that continuing as well into the future. So overall, a very large market, our NSX Everywhere strategy resonating, uniquely positioned in the marketplace, and you'll see us expanding more just like we've done with VeloCloud and then PKS into more use cases as well in the longer term."
1,"And together, our holiday LTO and lobby items had a negative impact of over 1 point of comp. We are aggressively rationalizing our merchandise approach in conjunction with the transformation of our lobby strategy going forward. Second, the challenge we have discussed with you over the past several quarters involving softness in business by occasional, non-Starbucks Rewards customers, a challenge likely exacerbated by the traditional changes in our customer routines and traffic patterns during holiday, continued with our afternoon and evening dayparts, typically catering to less frequent customers and second visits from more frequent customers, coming under increased pressure as the quarter progressed."
1,"And we acquired RXBAR, giving us a whole new growth platform. So 2017 was an important year for us, as we were able to deliver dependable results while making progress on key strategic initiatives, many of which were quite challenging. Now, let's turn our attention to 2018 and slide number 5."
1,"And we also increased our 2018 capital expenditures by another $1 billion. So while public policy stole a lot of the spotlight, we did make a lot of progress on several strategic initiatives last year. The most important is FirstNet, winning that FirstNet bid."
1,"And we announced, I guess, a little over a year ago, almost $650 million investment in our South Florida markets, Dade, Broward and West Palm to put more and more capacity on the marketplace. So it is an important part of our capital strategy to ensure that we've got the capacity to meet what we still project as growing demand for health in those markets."
1,"And we are benefiting from the successful integration of our recent acquisitions, which have had a dramatic impact on the scale and reach of the company and are providing a great opportunity for revenue growth. Our core full-year 2017 performance clearly demonstrates that our strategic plan is effective and we continue building shareholder value. Our full-year 2017 core revenue reached a record $479 million and increased 4% compared to the full-year 2016."
1,"And we are looking forward to having a spot where we have that free cash flow. We certainly are looking at reinvesting that in additional growth, as well as using that potentially to pay down some debt to quicker achieve our objectives."
1,"And we believe Cynosure, our Medical Aesthetics business, is turning the corner toward a future of consistent growth. Our solid performance in the first quarter demonstrates the two important elements of our strategic plan are paying off. First, our international business, which we described as a startup and was an area of great concern for investors as recently as 2016, is now thriving."
1,"And we believe that by being ahead in terms of these standards game, we do have an advantage to implement those new standards as and when they become available for general public, and clearly benefit from market leadership in that area. So, I would say that the investment side, we are continually focused on these two strategic priorities and I am happy with the progress that we've achieved in the last nine months of this fiscal year. Coming to summary, so at the macro level, as long as there is a lot of data growth and more 4G systems coming into picture, and more 5G as and when it happens, it will all result into higher capacity network, and that's really where there would be a need for higher deployment of optical transmission equipment and this is really where we come into the picture."
1,"And we continue to be very active in this space, with the underlying comment that our primary capital allocation is for organic growth drivers with M&A following in behind that. We really see organic growth as a fundamental driver with M&A being used to fill in our strategic priorities or accelerate our strategic plans."
1,"And we continue to have a high rate of compliance with the oral, every other day dosing regimen. Overall, we've seen adoption among these patient segments which is very much in line with our launch strategy and we expect this to continue throughout the year as we open up new markets and continue to penetrate into our existing markets. As a reminder, looking ahead to next quarter, we do expect to move away from the patient numbers metric and instead highlight quarterly revenue as a measure of progress towards our revenue goal for the year."
1,"And we expect in aggregate that will be over 2,000 by the end of this year. So we're able to fulfill a lot of the market's demands by using the complement of our offshore strategy."
1,"And we expect our net capital expenditure to be between $20 million and $25 million including the remodel of a minimum of three Generation I location. Let me now share some important metrics that underpin our 2018 guidance and support our strategic initiative. With respect to strategic pillar number one, growing per store profits."
1,"And we expect to see a significant additional opportunities to support damage assessments and related consulting and services, especially in these regions where we're already very well-established and have an very large network and offices, in areas like Texas, Florida and California. In fiscal year 2017, we began a strategic initiative here in the company to expand our high-end infrastructure business with a focus on sustainable engineering that uses less energy, facilities that recycle water, and create healthy environments for their occupants or individuals that actually visit the facilities. At the start of 2018, our fiscal year 2018, we added Glumac Engineering Group, based primarily in California here in the United States and just in January we announced the intent to acquire Norman Disney & Young or NDY, an Australian based firm that's going to add over 700 professionals in the high-end infrastructure design practice."
1,"And we got a very diverse customer base that's an advantage and as we begin to understand more about each of the industry verticals in which we do business, it's also allowing us to go deep and understand how we need to be tailoring our service offerings to really resonate with the key industry verticals that we do business with. And that's another big part of our strategy going forward. It's an evolution, it's a continued evolution, Proto Labs have evolved and continued to evolve and change ever since we were invented back 18 years ago."
1,And we have actually installed a number of means to make sure we get even more productive in the clinics and it is showing effect. But it is in the wholesale business of things you have to look for the scalability and the effect of the strategic initiatives.
1,"And we have now, for the first time, brought Tata Tea brand alongside of Tetley, and we have launched the Tata Tea Gold, a blend that we've created for the Bangladesh market. In terms of strategic priorities, our focus is on continuing to ensure and secure the base business. Then, our focus is on innovation and new product launches continues to drive the additional improvement in sales."
1,"And we have unutilized space, because there is a network footprint we wanted to build-out. So just having one warehouse and it being full doesn't really allow us to strategically achieve our objectives. So we needed to build-out different locations, which allow us then achieve our objectives, but then you have unutilized space, which we consider fine, we consider that part of the investment."
1,"And we like the laser business in particular, they've come out with some great products in the last several years, particularly last year, and we think it is some significant high growth area that we've really focused the team on. And then lastly, the general growth for MKS is when we implemented our strategic planning process about five years ago and we entered the strategic planning process with Newport when we first bought them, and allocating R&D dollars specifically to high growth opportunities within Newport, whereas in the past all the dollars were distributed in a more democratic way. So we would actually would take dollars away from particularly our interest in Newport and put it into an area of high focus which has created some great opportunities for us."
1,"And we think if our bispecifics start approaching, which we think they're beginning to, the sort of type of responses that people are reporting with CAR Ts, they could really represent a very, very important opportunity. And the thing that's also exciting about it is, our strategy includes both combining our bispecifics with our PD-1 as well as our bispecifics with each other. We have a number of bispecifics that at least, in our preclinical model, look like they can be additive, if not synergistic in their responses."
1,"And we want to make the right investments. So I think what's evident in this quarter particular is, yes, advertising was below all of our collective expectations which had a knock-on effect on our EBITDA performance, but that's not causing us to shy away from making the necessary investments whether or not it's in content or premium VOD or in advancing our advanced advertising and data strategy. So we are continuing to position the company for a healthy future state where we aspire to have more steady revenue growth."
1,"And we were a finalist in 2016 New York Stock Exchange Governance Awards. Finally, the strategic focus for executing on our long-term plan. We're looking at 8% to 10% growth in adjusted earnings per share for 2016 to 2022, but also from 2016 to 2020."
1,"And we will continue to focus on these priorities in 2018 and beyond as we execute against our vision of becoming a top 10 global restaurant brand. As you will hear from Michael shortly, we are confirming our long-term guidance for 2018 as we execute against these four strategic priorities. In 2017, we clearly demonstrated the ability to achieve our long-term growth targets even when our brand is faced with the toughest of challenges and deliver our commitment to shareholders of best-in-class returns."
1,And we will maintain our focus on investing in those that will make a material difference to the future of our business. Our consistent track record and today's results show how we are executing our strategy to sustain value creation. We have delivered VONB which is more than 5 times the 2010 figure.
1,"And we'll also be exploring other funding options and opportunities. The last pillar to expand through investment and acquisitions, which continues to be part of our growth strategy. We remain very opportunistic."
1,And we'll continue to build momentum with foam and Avelle. We'll also continue to execute our successful Ostomy strategy. These commercial initiatives will be the subject of greater focus and resource in 2018.
1,"And we'll go back over during the course of the year some of our plans and pilots on having greater degrees of direct labor. But those are medium to long-term plans to solve what we see as medium to long-term problems that are chronic rather than acute, under that where we have to invest if we want to control the quality and the availability and the price of our resources over the medium term rather than we think Q1 of 2018 are going to be particular problems."
1,"And we'll see it in a variety of ways looking at both the top line contributions in our business from a commercial standpoint, improvement in the gross margin, and also SG&A efficiency. And then I think what remains to be told is to what degree that flows to the bottom line versus reinvestment that we would make back into these strategic priorities. So we'll look forward to providing further updates as we get further down the road."
1,"And we're actually going to implement, and I think we talked about it in the opening a bit. A new strategic plan for this business. So we're going to setup kind of a new go-to-market sales strategy with a defined sales structure by which we used to have individual sales representatives that each had a book of accounts, and some of those accounts were new and some of those were renewals."
1,"And we're confident that this plan will deliver the kind of flexibility we will need to compete given the pace of change across this industry. This slide represents the key elements of our digital strategy. In short, we want to be high-tech and high touch as an organization, simple and easy to use, but there with the best expertise in the market when our customers need it."
1,"And we're confident that we're putting the necessary pieces in place to drive long-term growth. We are firmly committed to the continued execution of our strategic plan and we appreciate your ongoing support. We acknowledge that there is a great deal of work ahead of us, but we have got a talented, very committed team in place, and we're poised to capture the opportunities ahead of us."
1,"And we're looking at everything, from our cost of goods, looking at all costs are hitting, quite frankly, COGS. We're looking carefully at our pricing strategy and we're looking at areas like professional services where we really need to improve our margin profile. I think our core business to margins are performing quite well."
1,"And we're putting a lot of focus on that and we're also putting a lot of focus on the Digital go-to market. We've seen significant, as you saw from the results   especially not just in Q4, but over the course of the year, we've seen terrific results with our Digital go-to market strategy and we're going to continue to lean into that very, very heavily. We put a new team in place in that group during Q4, and we think we've really got the right team there to drive the growth in that area."
1,"And we're really focused now on putting in the right investments in talent, of course, and driving up awareness for the brand in that market, not only in the Mainland, but also in Hong Kong, Macau and in Taiwan. And then, the second part of our strategy, not directly connected to your question, Ike, is what we're doing with the Australia, New Zealand buyback of Coach, which is really about leveraging a Tapestry multi-brand model to allow us to successfully grow our brands in the smaller, medium-sized markets, where each of them independently would not have the scale to be managed directly, so very excited about that opportunity, and look forward to sharing more on that with you in the future as well."
1,"And we've got procurement savings that we have actually achieved already in the first half but they really start to deliver in the second half and beyond. So as I mentioned, the strategic plan is network expansion, and we've also started to do key sales and leadership training, which is being deployed at the moment. And as I mentioned before, the segment that shows here is the Australian Wholesale business has become part of our Bapcor's Wholesale business segment for the next reporting period."
1,"And we've not attempted to reinvent the wheel, reinvent all the pieces of the culture, simply taking the decision to emphasize four points. Four points that we think will help support our growth strategy, that we want people to feel empowered. Any large organization, institutional company, people will tend to imagine there are more rules than there actually are."
1,"And what that means? The right deal for us, it has to fit in our strategy and we like proprietary processes, because in this business you're not buying a asset base, you're really acquiring a group of people that run a business with relationship with customers and suppliers and that needs to be maintained. And so periods of transition create risk in our acquisition strategy and we're cognizant of that and we're very careful about how we approach that."
1,"And when I say Regency's platform, I am talking about owning premier centers that over time we're able to access anchor spaces, transform the nature of the center through redevelopment and capture not only the significant mark-to-market opportunity on the anchor spaces but the accretive shop rent growth for years to come. All these examples illustrate our team's commitment to planning and execution of our strategic plan to fortify our long-term NOI growth, one asset at a time. Mac will now highlight our development capabilities and future value-add opportunities."
1,"And when it comes to capital allocation, we like our strategy. We believe in our strategy, and we're going to look for new capabilities that will help us expand that to achieve that strategy even quicker."
1,"And when you get to the right   when you get to that perfect service level, you develop a whole new dialog with customers, it's about value creation, it's about joint business planning, that's about how you grow categories, not swap share back and forth, but grow categories and then grow within that. And so it's really born of looking at customers and seeing and understanding what they need, and where our strategy overlaps with their strategy is really creating that in-store theater, that in-store delight that moment where the shopper sees the brand and it's in stock and perfectly merchandised. That's a win for both of us."
1,"And when you put all of that together, it creates a compelling financial story for IHOP. So to wrap things up, we have a new world-class leadership team in place and we've built a comprehensive strategy with franchisee collaboration and our strategy is grounded in deep guest insights and advanced analytics. We have significant upside potential for future growth with day part and platform expansion opportunities and we have the ability to accelerate restaurant growth with newly developed formats in underpenetrated and non-traditional markets."
1,"And while supply will continue to move up modestly in response to low vacancy rates, developer behavior will remain disciplined with respect to both starting new projects as well as leasing them. As a result, our strategy for operating our portfolio, deploying capital and selling assets remains the same. While we're not projecting our occupancy levels will move up from here, we expect that significant growth in rents, as well as rent bumps will continue driving same-store results."
1,"And while we continue to be opportunistically pursuing both organic and inorganic growth opportunities to generate strong free cash flow, we remain committed to our core strategy of expanding our services and reach in our markets and taking our core competency of taking care of people, to other verticals and geographic markets. Working safely and efficiently, delivering unmatched service, generating free cash flow, improving the balance sheet, and driving strong operational performance across all segments will continue to remain our strategic priorities. With that, I'll turn it over to Frank for a detailed review of our financial performance."
1,"And with a more efficient product development process, we believe we are actually delivering more for less. Overall, from a financial and operational perspective, we are right where we need to be at midyear to achieve our objectives for fiscal 2018 and set us up for fiscal 2019 and beyond. Now, before I hand the call over to James, I wanted to mention two things."
1,"And with this, logistics and distribution network that we have today where we have 200 hubs, we could be able to double the company's GMV. The second question regarding the C2C, our strategy is to offer more possibilities to our clients. Today, we have 15 million active clients on our platform."
1,"And without these bigger claims in this liability portfolio, the combined ratio in Germany would have been below 100. At the Investor Day, we have announced our five-year strategy to take Germany back into profit. And, of course, we stick to that and we are clearly progressing as we have changed substantially the content or the portfolio   the Non-Life portfolio away from the industrial risks down by approximately 25% and growth in the retail business in Non-Life by almost 20% over the last two years."
1,"And, GaÃ«l, and we'll keep you informed of the developments, of course. But it's important to be consistent, consistent in our targets and consistent in our strategic priorities. Concerning India, it has become, I would say, in the past 15 years a very strong presence for Schneider."
1,"Another important part of TYMLOS lifecycle management is developments of the transdermal patch for TYMLOS, and this is really a key component of our ability to expand the global footprint for TYMLOS, as well as to extend the franchise with extended exclusivity. Our strategy for the transdermal patch is to bridge the patch dates back to our subcutaneous product. We've made a lot of recent progress on the developments of this patch."
1,"Anyways, let's start again. Good morning and thank you very much for giving us the opportunity to present our financial year end results and the progress for 2014-2019 strategic plan. I would like to welcome everyone attending in person as well as those joining us via webcast."
1,"Approximately 50% of ISP sales revenues are subject to this increase. Looking ahead, we believe that we can more than double ISP's contribution margin dollar by 2020 by executing key elements of our strategic plan, including growing the base business volumes with advantaged pricing and margins, making acquisitions in attractive adjacent markets that have favorable market structures, increasing sales and new end uses, and continuing to launch new value-added products from a pipeline of some 30 potential opportunities. Now, let me turn to our business outlook for this year."
1,"Are we planning to do anything different in terms of our CapEx at the TDS Telecom level? Because of this, no, I think we've got very long-term plans that are our plans, and we'll continue to invest in our networks because we do want to get more fiber out into our territory. So, that's what we're prepared to say at this point."
1,"Aritzia is a vertically integrated fashion brand. First, we have a differentiated global sourcing strategy that allows us to continually refine our supply chain to elevate our product whilst increasing the value to our customers. Second, we have innovative and creative strategies that ensure we provide a balanced assortment of beautiful, high quality products that our customer desires."
1,"As a conclusion, I would like to mention that the 2017 year was a complex year, mainly due to situation of the electricity business in Spain. But despite this, it has allowed us to mainly focus the goals of the 2018-2020 strategic plan, mainly due to the strong performance of regulated businesses, especially gas networks and international power generations. Secondly, we already mentioned it a few times, the negative performance and the abnormally adverse and extraordinary conditions of the electricity business in Spain, which have had a negative impact, as I said, in this business and in the EBITDA level."
1,"As a market leader in credentialing, privileging and enrollment, our new Verity platform gives us the opportunity to migrate thousands of customers to our higher margin, more serviceable SaaS platform in the coming years. The third strategic initiative designed to improve our long-run operating income and EBITDA was the decision to divest our Patient Experience business. Despite the margin improvements in the second half of last year, the Patient Experience business was historically challenged to deliver the growth and profitability of our other two business segments."
1,"As a market leader in credentialing, privileging, and enrollment, our new Verity platform gives us the opportunity to migrate thousands of customers to our higher margin more serviceable SaaS platform in the coming years. The third strategic initiative designed to improve our long run operating income and EBITDA was with the decision to divest our Patient Experience business. Despite the margin improvements in the second half of last year, the Patient Experience business was historically challenged to deliver the growth and profitability of our other two business segments."
1,"As a reminder, availability under the credit facility is based upon performance of the company over the most recently completed 12 months. The company's liquidity continues to support execution of our strategic plans, funding of working capital, letters of credit required to support an expanding backlog and funding capital expenditures with a target below 1% of annual revenue. Finally, let's discuss guidance."
1,"As a reminder, the benefit from selling through these alternative channels is substantial, which is why I'm so excited about the progress we made in 2017 and the opportunity still ahead of us. I'm also pleased with the way our teams pulled together in the quarter to drive savings through our cost mitigation efforts and as you will hear from Larry shortly, we made further progress to improve productivity in the quarter both for our manpower planning and shuttling strategic initiatives. Consequently, Americas' adjusted EBITDA increased 6% in the quarter to $107 million driven by revenue growth as well as from the benefits of greater efficiencies and our cost saving measures."
1,"As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and a replay will be made available following the conclusion of the call. Our discussion will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our future and financial operating performance, including our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance, business strategy, demand for our solutions, product development, client satisfaction and retention, market or business growth, investment activity in our business, visibility into our business model and results, the effect of capitalized development costs, spending on R&D, professional services and other aspects of our business, the use of proceeds from the sale of our convertible notes, our appraisal of our competitors and their products, our ability to compete effectively, our ability to realize potential benefits from both our recent and ongoing operational excellence and recurring revenue and margin improvement initiative, changes to our corporate governance structure and our proposed strategic plan to strengthen our business. Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions."
1,"As a result of the acquisition of Metropolitan, coupled with organic balance sheet growth, our assets exceeded $10 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2017. In order to delay the adverse impact of the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other things, imposes limitations on the amount of debit card interchange fees certain banking institutions may collect, we initiated several strategic initiatives to manage our consolidated assets below $10 billion at December 31, 2017, which is the threshold at which bank holding companies are subject to the Durbin Amendment. More specifically, we sold certain investment securities and shortened the holding period of our mortgage loans held for sale."
1,As a result the company maintains cautious stance on its business operation and a financial performance in the coming year. The company will continuously work closely to visit customer to generate new revenue stream and growth together and it will further improve production efficiency and a product mix of its full production line to sustain its profitability and the company remains committed to executing it's major strategic initiative and improve its presence in analog IC specialty and designated market so as to sustain its growth and the development in 2018 and beyond. Thank you.
1,"As a result, we're confident in our ability to deliver the higher sales and EBITDA targets in our updated outlook. We will continue to execute on our three strategic priorities, focusing on specific customers, restaurant segments and geographies as well as expanding our range of product offerings through innovation; differentiating our global supply chain to strengthen our competitive advantage as a low-cost producer; and investing in additional capacity and acquisition opportunities to support growth. We are well positioned to serve and grow with our customers, generate solid returns, and create value for all our stakeholders over the long term."
1,"As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; < Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and the senior vice presidents of our business segments also are available for questions. On this call, we will focus on fourth quarter and year-end 2017 financial results and provide some additional color on our strategic and accretive growth projects, including our recently announced Arbuckle II Pipeline, MB-4 Fractionator and Demicks Lake projects."
1,"As Bob alluded to, we have a lot going on at The Tile Shop. We just completed our national store managers' meeting, and that was an opportune time for our company leaders to convey the new strategic plan to our store managers who in turn are spreading the word throughout the company. I believe we're galvanized around a plan that will return the company to higher growth and profitability."
1,"As can be seen, we've delivered consistent revenue growth, strong operating margin and earnings progress as well as a consistent free cash flow over the last four years. This performance proves our strategy is working and it's laid the strong foundations from which to drive the next phase of growth in Coats. And with that, I'll hand you back to Rajiv to wrap up and summarize our outlook for 2018."
1,"As discussed last quarter, we reviewed our operating model and cost structure to improve profitability and better align to our long-term strategy, Ingenuity 2025. We took actions to achieve our objectives and provide for long-term shareholder value creation. These actions included voluntary retirement incentive packages to certain senior managers."
1,"As every Q4, we have the Executive Chairman who will open the presentation with the key takeaways for the full year and obviously the Q4. Our CEO, JosÃ© Antonio Ãlvarez, will address the group and business areas review, and then our Executive Chairman will comment and share with you our 2018 key strategic priorities. And obviously, we will time as always for Q&A."
1,"As far as the Airgas synergies are concerned, we are ahead of plan in 2017, in particular, cost synergies, which amount to an accumulated value of â‚¬190 million since the acquisition, or â‚¬215 million, if we add up revenue synergies. Finally, our strategic plan, NEOS, is well on track. In fact, we are delivering in the short term, with concrete initiatives that have already improved our efficiency, and we are also investing for the long term in innovation."
1,"As for costs, we are changing our method. We are changing our cost management strategy. Some of our actions are going to take a bit longer as well to be implemented as for reduction of cost related to personnel."
1,"As for gross profit, the decline was largely a result of the continuing investments we are making to support manufacturing innovation, sales and marketing functions, as well as employee safety and physical plant condition. We believe these strategic initiatives will benefit ZCL and improve the company's profitability going forward. We continue to be prudent stewards of the capital entrusted to us by ZCL shareholders and we continue to preserve a strong balance sheet which allows us the flexibility to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities as they arise."
1,"As George said, we hope the sessions with our management team today have helped you gain a better understanding of our capabilities and priorities for our next strategic plan. We are confident the four strategic priorities we set out will deliver a further fundamental transformation of the group."
1,"As guided, we continue to experience some short-term transitional impacts from the stabilization of our distribution base that are reflected in today's numbers. However, as Bob discussed, we've made meaningful progress on a number of important strategic initiatives since our last call, and we're seeing more favorable trends in key metrics such as our domestic pay-TV subscribers. These actions and trends will lay the foundation for growth in revenue, OI and EPS in the second half of 2018 and beyond."
1,"As I mentioned earlier, Applebee's and IHOP are in the perfect position to provide exceptional in-restaurant and to-go experiences, in my opinion like no other brand. The fourth D in our 4D strategy is delivery. We have reinvented the to-go experience from top to bottom, by introducing best-in-class packaging and branding, along with partnering with some of the best in the delivery industry."
1,"As I mentioned, we'll use some of that excess cash to make investments in our digital platform. The remainder will be used to repurchase additional shares, which reflects our confidence in our strategy going forward. So, overall, to summarize, we're very pleased with our progress."
1,"As I said at a recent investor conference, the cornerstone of our strategy is around the integration of primary care, pharmacy, home and behavioral health, while leveraging technology and analytics to create a holistic 360-degree view of the customer, and from that, drive a simplified, personalized experience for members that makes it easy for them to achieve their best health. Our strategy has continued to evolve over the last year and we've been very active in building our primary care model. As I indicated in last quarter's earnings call, in 2017, we launched 15 new clinics in 7 markets."
1,"As I said at the beginning of the call, I am excited about the opportunity S&W has before it as a unique middle-market agricultural company. We have gone through an extensive, strategic planning process and believe we have laid out a pathway that allows us to maximize our upside, while minimizing our risk profile and ultimately creating shareholder value. Thank you for your continued support."
1,"As I said, Katz is meeting every one of our expectations on the distribution side, on the rating side and on the revenue side since we acquired the company. A lot of our 2018 strategic plan and budget is around the success that they would have had in the upfront, which concluded recently. They hit all of their upfront target numbers."
1,"As I said, the time spend over the next two or three months is going to be around the four pillars which will build upon the strategy refresh that Nandan has launched. Coming out of that will be a set of strategic priorities that we want to drive. And we will hold an Investor Day in April to talk about it."
1,"As I tell our team members, change is coming, be ready. The last element of our strategic plan, prudent working capital management to maximize cash flows and allow us to reinvest in growth areas of the business. Our cash flow from operations year-to-date was a source of $4 million compared to a use of $3 million in the prior year-to-date period."

1,"As is the case with Lithium, in 2018, our volumes in certain of our Bromine derivatives are fully committed. In closing, our strategy is unfolding as we planned. We exceeded our operational and financial commitments in 2017."
1,"As is usual, I will give you some highlights of our results and then hand it over to Kevin, who will talk about the results in more detail. Then, I'll come back up and describe the performance of each of our four divisions as well as our progress against our strategic initiatives and then finish up with the outlook for 2018. So, we delivered solid organic growth of 3% in 2017, with all four divisions achieving organic growth in line with or better than the prior year."
1,"As it relates to preferred, investors are still very hungry for income, and the tax reform didn't change that picture, prefers relative to other fixed income segments. We are seeing more interest in our low-duration preferred strategy. And just to put that into perspective, our low-duration strategy yields about 4%, and the duration is 2."
1,"As I've said before, there are no silver bullets. These results simply speak to continued progress from the rigorous, methodical execution of our strategic plan, a plan which we have been unwavering in our belief that represents the best route to delivering value for our stakeholders. 2018 will be a year of building and further investing to allow us to deliver the best omnichannel retail experience in the industry and sets the foundation for sustainable long-term growth."
1,"As Mike noted, we continue to take a thoughtful look at our overall risk return profile and specifically our ceded reinsurance program. While we remain confident in our general strategy and the program's core components, there are always lessons to be learned and we have taken meaningful steps to enhance our protections, which Greg will detail, and which reduce our pro forma catastrophe exposures as illustrated on slides 15 and 16. We believe these reductions and exposures are aligned with the market conditions we are seeing in early 2018."
1,"As Mike touched on, we've done a couple of small acquisitions and there are some other attractive opportunities in the pipeline. I mentioned we added innovation to our strategic priorities. Internally, we're looking for opportunities to develop our service for the benefit of our customers and also to drive profitability."
1,"As of December 2017, we had enrolled more than 230 sellers and increased our catalog almost three times. We have strategic plans for each category to continue expanding the online assortment. This year, the eCommerce business, which comprised Grocery Home Shopping and General Merchandise operations, grew 34%."
1,"As our cash returned to owners has grown, so too has our dividend as a percentage of the cash return. We continue to believe a sustainable growing dividend is an important element of our capital management strategy. Our objective in repurchasing shares is the accretive capture of free cash flow for long-term investors."
1,"As part of this, we recently announced the restructure of the executive leadership team with the appointment of business leaders in both Australia and New Zealand. John O'Neill and Wayne Chapman are both experienced media executives and will take responsibility for overseeing the day-to-day operations of our business and the execution of our strategy in their respective markets. And importantly, these appoints will enable me to dedicate greater degree of focus on the strategic direction and future growth opportunities of the group as a whole."
1,"As previously flanked, the Construction EBITDA was impacted by underperformance in a small number of engineering projects. A capital partner was introduced to our Retirement Living business at a premium to book value, endorsing our strategy to focus on the aging demographic and providing further growth capital for this business. Our Investments segment recorded growth in funds under management of 15% to AUD 28."
1,"As previously indicated, we believe this more balanced capital return policy provides greater flexibility to maintain top flight investment capabilities, provide seed capital for potential new product initiatives, pursue inorganic growth opportunities and fund accretive share repurchases. Importantly, it will also allow us to execute on our corporate strategy even during times of market stress. Clearly, recent tax law changes are a positive for our company and will serve as an additional enhancement to our financial flexibility."
1,"As relates to 2018 G&A, 2017 we landed around $11. 7 million inside that G&A, includes approximately $2 million of non-cash stock compensation and then the strategic initiatives we alluded to was $1. 3 million, giving us a core G&A around $8."
1,"As such, we will continue to ramp up our emphasis on new product innovation and business developments to support this objective. We look forward to updating you on these strategic initiatives, particularly in many of our existing and exciting pipeline of programs at our upcoming Investor Conference on May 21st in New York City. In summary, while we have a lot of hard work ahead as we continue to position for the future, I'm confident that we are up to the task."
1,"As that happens, you'll see our reported numbers in the scanner data become more representative of the performance of the business. For the second half of fiscal 2018, we will expand, execute against our strategic plan for growth. This includes brand-building efforts and investments in our top 11 brands, which we expect to generate ongoing momentum for the top 500 SKUs across the total channel view, especially in non-measured channels, particularly with positive performance in e-commerce."
1,"As the team noted, fourth quarter sales accelerated, delivering our best quarter of the year. Margins continued to demonstrate quarterly sequential improvement, which has been one of our objectives throughout the year. As I review the quarter and the year, my comments will focus on the adjusted financials, which exclude certain items as detailed in the press release and tabled on pages 4 through 9 of the investor presentation."
1,"As Tim mentioned, earlier this morning, we furnished an updated investor presentation which provides an overview of Banc of California today and perhaps more importantly, outlines the key financial objectives we expect to achieve by the end of 2020. We recently finalized our three-year strategic plan, which serves as our roadmap for our journey. Last quarter, we committed to deliver a strategic roadmap to our investors and share our vision of where we are going and to provide a few guidepost to track our progress along the way."
1,"As to the Fenghuang and Yidian's product strategy, actually, we're not in a position to comment other players. But for us, at current stage, our strategy is to focus on our two flagship apps. One is ifeng News, the other is Yidian news."
1,"As we approach our 20th anniversary and reflect on what we've built, we remain true to our core principles of delivering a global platform for our customers' infrastructure. We have a clear vision of our strategy and opportunities ahead and are looking forward to another successful year. So, let me stop there and we'll open it for questions."
1,"As we celebrate the 40th anniversary of our founding this year, our steadfast commitments to taking exceptional care of our guests and staff members has been integral to our success. This long-term mindset guides our strategic initiatives and paves the way for a solid future. With that, I'll now turn the call over to David Gordon for our marketing and operational update."
1,"As we continue to make the changes that are needed for us, it will be this team that makes it happen. I firmly believe we have the right team to execute the next steps in our strategic plan. Our team across the globe continues to identify new opportunities to add value to our existing customers and potential new customers, reduce costs, and increase our internal efficiencies."
1,"As we continue to refine our product supply chain, we expect to identify additional opportunities to capitalize on market trends. Second, I am extremely pleased with the progress we are making on our store expansion strategy. We continue to gain access to premier locations that we believe will drive profit and brand exposure over the long-term."
1,"As we continue transferring ownership of stores to WBA, we will also continue to focus on our most significant business-building opportunities heading forward. In just a few moments, Kermit will spend some time discussing our strategic priorities and providing an update on our key initiatives. In terms of our third quarter results, our pro forma adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $153 million, which includes $24 million in fees that would have been received if all of the divested stores were being managed under the TSA Agreement as of the beginning of the period, was in line with our expectations."
1,"As we discussed today, we have attractive opportunities to continue to invest in the growth of the company leveraging our embedded inventory. With respect to returning capital to shareholders, management and the board regularly review decisions and policies based on our strategic plan. In recent years, we have been mindful of the limitations in the Tax Matters Agreement related to the RMT."
1,"As we enter our fifth full year of operations, we see a bright future and opportunities to add to our track record of success. From day one, we have managed the business in preparation for a rising rate environment and continue to view our business model of long-term leases with annual built-in organic growth, an investment grade tenant, conservative financial management, and a focused approach to growth is continuing to support our strategy of reliable, durable and growing results for our unitholders. We're off to a good start in 2018 with a successful debt transaction already behind us and an active pipeline of investments."
1,"As we get further clarity on the capital requirements for future phases of development in Guyana as well as the outlook for oil prices, we plan to evaluate additional returns of capital to shareholders. Key to our strategy is our position in Guyana, an extraordinary oil investment opportunity that is uniquely advantaged by its scale, reservoir quality, cost, rapid cash paybacks and superior financial returns. The Stabroek block in Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest, covers 6."
1,"As we have discussed in the last several quarters, we've taken actions to curtail growth in some segments, and we expect that the growth rate in personal loans will continue to slow. Our strategy will remain focused on originating profitable, quality loans. We will not pursue growth simply for the sake of growth."
1,"As we look ahead to 2018, we're confident that we're on the right path to deliver profitable growth. Our strategy is working. And, today, we have announced a clear path to enhance our financial strength and flexibility."
1,"As we look at our 2018 initiatives, they're as robust as ever. And I would tell you that I'm very excited about our strategic initiatives, and especially the two that I outlined in the call today to help continue to drive that traffic for many years to come."
1,"As we look at the business, and Bob and Gregg will get into it in more detail, but our signature business Search, which gives us unparalleled access, was up 18%; Futurestep was up 29%; and our advisory Hay Group was up 13% for the quarter. Going forward, we're going to continue to maintain a relentless focus on the how of our strategy. Number one, driving an integrated, proactive data-driven go-to-market strategy, which is going to include more and more of an industry and solution orientation rather than line of business focus."
1,"As we look to leverage these achievements, it was the right time to dedicate a small team to focus on opportunities that could accelerate profitable growth, while also deepening our reach into the educator market. Matt Sharpe worked closely with me on many of our successful, strategic initiatives such as modernizing our Life operations and creating a differentiated approach to retirement that leverages our multi-line business model. I'm confident that by dedicating more focus to business development efforts, we will be able to more efficiently identify and act upon opportunities to accelerate profitable growth."
1,"As we navigate this volatility, we continue to have the operational flexibility to adjust our spending and activity plans based on changes in the commodity price environment. In conclusion, we see our 2017 results making big strides towards delivering on our strategic priorities. This includes our best-ever safety and environmental results, further improving cost and capital efficiency, increasing production and funds flow and holding strong financial liquidity as we develop plans to balance our capital structure."
1,"As we progress through the remainder of this fiscal year, we will look to build on the momentum from our positive first quarter performance, continuing to manage the things we can control, delivering continued improvement and operating performance, and executing on our customer base growth and retention initiatives. In the meantime, from a financial perspective, as earnings improved, our leverage will continue to trend toward our target levels and we've plenty of liquidity and access to capital to continue to pursue our strategic initiatives. Finally, I'd like to thank all of the more than 3,200 employees of Suburban Propane for their unwavering focus on the safety and comfort of our customers."

We are ramping up our existing capacities and have taken specific action to grow our volumes across all our businesses."
1,"As you all know, Earls Court Properties represents Capco's investments in the Earls Court and West Kensington Opportunity Area.

Capco's objective is to ensure we maximize the opportunity of this important new scheme."
1,"As you can see, this is clearly a unique agreement between two leaders in the mobility industry to develop self-driving technology, and we're very excited to be part of it. The emerging new mobility landscape is creating many new opportunities for Magna and partnerships like this put us at the forefront of change, while also supporting our building blocks strategy that positions us for tomorrow. Operator, we'll now like to open the line up to any questions."
1,"As you can tell, we're very excited about the acquisition of Jive. It accelerates our strategy to move into the large and rapidly growing UCaaS market. It's highly complementary to our existing product portfolio and will be accretive to growth and to margin."
1,"As you heard Jim mention, 2017 was another solid year for us, both operationally and financially. We continue to execute well against our strategic priorities, driving further EBITDA and EPS growth despite choppy comps largely attributed to some transitory issues. For the full year, net sales increased 4% on a constant currency basis, gross margin rate expanded 40 basis points, adjusted EBITDA increased 5%, and adjusted EPS increased 8%."
1,"As you highlight, the yields are compressing and you still, in our view, haven't reached the desired portfolio size in those countries. Is your strategy to keep on buying or how you view the yields at the moment? Is it still the right time to continue growing strongly and then what do you envision to be the timeframe to actually reach critical mass?"
1,"As you know, the retail landscape is rapidly changing and we will continue to build upon our competitive strengths to take advantage of the opportunities that market disruption has created. The progress we made against our strategic priorities in 2017 gives us confidence that our investments are paying off in the form of a stronger business that's better positioned for long-term growth. We look forward to continuing the momentum in 2018 and further extending our leadership in the home furnishings industry."
1,"As you recall, we took 2017 as the year to optimize the recent acquisitions that we accomplished and we think we are significantly behind that accomplishment. So, really our goal now going forward is to continue on our strategic plan. And so, on the fee base side, we'd like to supplement the wealth business if we could, again with some expansions of our product offering or deepening of our existing product offering or continuing with our pattern of what I would call small and easily integrateable acquisition, so think about those in total deal consideration size of $5 million to $20 million, similar to the two acquisitions we had several years ago."
1,"As, you know, given the very strong demand that we see over the next five-plus years, we were already had on the books a potential fourth and fifth train that requires a greenfield buildout at the Madison site. And over the last several months, as we stare into our strategic plans that are coming up over the next couple of months, there is just immediate and readily available space in this world-class facility. In fact, I was just there a couple of weeks ago."
1,"Aside from the modest growth plans, our focus for 2018 will be on the basics. Unlike the past seven years, we have no major strategic initiatives that are landing in 2018, and that allows a more intense focus on running a great airline, offering outstanding customer service and controlling our cost. Capital spending will also be down this year."
1,"Assuming the impact on a year-over-year basis, our costs associated with strategic investments, incentive compensation and severance and restructuring costs are neutralized, we expect year-over-year EBITDA improvement. Looking at 2020 and beyond, assuming we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives, we expect to approach revenue growth in the mid to high single digits and operating margins of 15% plus implemented over the medium term. Despite our more recent challenges, I believe the fundamentals of this business and industry remain intact."
1,"At Automatic, which we acquired in 2017, we are planning a push to scale its aftermarket connected vehicle business and tap new revenue opportunities from a growing base of users by leveraging our relationships with hardware manufacturers, auto dealers and our existing billing and marketing infrastructure. This remains an exciting start-up business, operating within SiriusXM that could lend some interesting applications and benefits to our broader strategy in connected vehicles. Outside of the car, it has never been easier to enjoy SiriusXM on the go or at home, be it on your phone with your smart speaker or your smart TV."
1,"At current levels and reflecting expected working capital outflows in 2018, Coalition free cash flow should land in the range of CAD 155 million to CAD 175 million, which would translate to a range of between CAD 120 million and CAD 145 million on a consolidated basis. 2017 saw us deliver on our guidance and make progress against our strategic priorities. We maintained a robust balance sheet, saw growth to Aeroplan in 2017 accompanied by a significant jump in profitability as we started to deliver on cost savings."
1,"At its heart, of course, is our purpose, to make your world a safer place. And the three strategic priorities that we've outlined before that will enable us to deliver on our purpose. It also identifies the 11 core capabilities that we are building out that we believe will not only optimize our core business but position us to create future growth options."
1,"At the end of the day, our overriding goal and we can't emphasize this too much, is to drive FFO per share and total returns for our stockholders. Speaking of success, a key component of our strategic plan is our investment program. Let me now turn the call over to Dan DuPree, to provide some color on our acquisition activity and our real estate loan investment program."
1,"At the same time, we are working with partners to position Upverter as a cloud-based ECAD platform for the supply chain industry. IoT360 is a key part of our strategy for bringing about the transformation in electronics design and its realization. Another significant event in this first half is internal restructuring that we call Altium Org 2."
1,"At the same time, we must think about how we can expand LabCorp's role over time in the rapidly-evolving healthcare system. We are focused on three strategic initiatives to broaden our role in the healthcare system of the future. First, we will support our customers' transition to value-based care."
1,"At the same time, we need to be growing margin. The strategic initiatives and focus areas that I talked about earlier, both productivity and the doubling down on competitive advantage and superiority, both work in our favor in that regard going forward. So, everything that we're doing, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, is designed to drive both in a balanced way."
1,"At the same time, we put capital to work to generate future returns. We also made good progress on our major strategic initiatives. Our Esterhazy K3 complex is nearing completion and we have produced the first meaningful tonnes of potash from the new facility."
1,"At the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, Philips continued to play a leading role in the transition to the circular economy. For example, as part of our healthy people, sustainable planet strategy, we have pledged that Philips will take back all large medical equipment that our customers are using and repurpose traded-in materials in a responsible way. Overall, we aim to deliver 15% of total revenues from circular solutions by 2020, for example, through innovative service models, smart upgrade path and remanufacturing programs."
1,"At this point, our long-term plan is to own those shares. We think that there's a tremendous amount of upside in the trading range for those shares."
1,"At this stage, it would not be appropriate for me to indicate our initiatives, but let me assure you we are working towards that. And at an appropriate time, we would come out with the full details on our strategy and action plan on the IDF, but certainly you have a very valid point, which you've made and we are quite conscious and working towards that."
1,"At this time, it's very important for us to discuss with you our views on 2018 as well as long-term shareholder value creation. And regarding 2018, I'd like to hand it over to Bob Ramsey to share with you some of our strategic priorities and plans."
1,"Back in August last year, I talked about the success of IHG's strategic model and the crucial role that this has played in our consistent market outperformance over the past few years. I also talked about my intention to work our model harder in the future and so today, we are announcing a series of new strategic initiatives, which represent a meaningful change in how we run our business. They're aimed at positioning us to deliver industry leading, net rooms growth over the medium term, as well as continued strong returns for our shareholders."
1,"Back to the group level, there's also an important message we want to mention. Our leverage peaked in 2017 and has started to move down to meet our target in 2020, as our strategy Shaping 2030 is on schedule. We have initiated the bottom-up synergy validation, and I will give you further details on that at the end of my presentation."
1,"Bard on December 29th of 2017. The combination of BD and Bard further accelerates our strategy of providing solutions for our customers. We are committed to providing our customers with products and value-added services all the way through full solutions to enable better, safer care at a lower cost."
1,"Based on customer and associated volume growth in PSBC as well as positive impacts from the strategic realignment in Corporate Clients, we expect higher underlying revenues in both operating segments. As previously guided, cost reductions are back-end loaded and our strategic plan depend on the success of our digitalization efforts. In 2018, we will continue our strict cost management and targeted cost base of around â‚¬7 billion."
1,"Based on our 2017 TruBridge bookings which were up 41% year-over-year, we expect solid growth for TruBridge in 2018, and we are confident that TruBridge will eclipse the $100 million revenue milestone for the full year. The core of our long-term growth strategy into 2019 and beyond centers on recurring revenue and customer retention. Our customer retention rate for Evident clients for 2017 stands at 96%, and for Healthland, 93%."
1,"Based on our dividend guidance of $1 per share per quarter in 2018, we anticipate with retaining close to half the capital that will be required to support these initiatives. We certainly have access to credit facilities with ample capacity to fund the remainder, but that goes against our objectives of reducing our overall leverage. Therefore, our solution is to generate the remainder by recycling capital."
1,"Based on our excellent Q1 performance and strong 2018 outlook, amplified by favorable tax reform, we're raising our guidance for 2018. Finally, we continue to execute well on our capital allocation strategy, striking an appropriate balance of organic and inorganic investments, plus returning capital to shareholders to drive sustainable, long-term value. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."
1,"based. Given these opportunities, our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. We expect M&A will continue to use about 60% of our free cash flow, with the remainder returned to our shareholders in the form of dividends and periodic share buybacks."
1,"Basically, Baoneng Group will take their proportionate shares to Chery, the guarantees decreased, and as a result, they would repay Kenon approximately RMB 130 million or approximately $18 million out of the total RMB 244 million previously provided. The investor has a bigger strategic plan, as we understand, to enter the car automotive sector. And it provided also, in the Investment Agreement, a commitment to purchase approximately 100,000 vehicles from Qoros each year between 2018 and 2020."
1,"Because definitely, we're giving you an   well, what we're giving you today, and that was not something that we're planning to give next year. So, talking about this guidance, what we want to give you is something that is very much in tune with our long-term strategy, and then, Jean will we probably add something, which is to be really in the midterm, in the long-term going to get toward value creation through our top line growth, superior top line growth. That's very important for us."
1,"Before I close, I just want to reiterate our focus on delivering on our 2018 commitments as we capitalize on market opportunities and leverage our competitive strengths.

Now we'll be happy to take a couple questions."

1,"Before I move on to a discussion about the quarter, I'd like to comment on 2017. Our investment into 2017 moved us forward significantly, aligning many of the changes we have made over the past several years with the strategic objective of our long-term plan. In the year, we completed a full turn on our rebuild of accounting, financial processes and controls, matured our operational bench extending visibility and runway to how we execute."
1,"Before I turn it over to Steve, a few comments on our 2018 priorities. At this point, our new strategic plan is in place and has been communicated throughout the organization.

1,"Before I turn the call to Mandeep, I want to thank the entire global Celestica team for driving new growth in our portfolio enhancement initiatives, while effectively dealing with volatility in pricing, volume and mix in our Communications and Enterprise markets. We have a strong team and I am very appreciative of their commitment to deliver exceptional service to our customers, while continuing to implement our exciting and comprehensive transformation strategy. Now, let me turn the call over to Mandeep."
1,"Before jumping into the key outcomes of our plan, I want to highlight on slide 4 the transformation and strategic portfolio actions that have been delivered over the last couple of years to position Noble Energy with a top-tier asset portfolio and a clear future. We've accomplished an impressive portfolio transformation while executing on our strategy to allocate capital to the highest return, highest margin assets. Early in 2017, we solidified the largest Southern Delaware Basin acreage position with the acquisition of Clayton Williams Energy."
1,"Before turning to 2018 guidance, I'd like to reinforce what Mark spoke about earlier regarding the evolution of our earnings profile with our fee business now expected to contribute more than 50% of our earnings before corporate and other going forward. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, one of our objectives in completing this sell-down plan is to accelerate that evolution toward more fee-based earnings. And as you see on slide 17, we expect the execution of this element of our capital strategy combined with the ongoing growth of our fee business to result in as much as 60% of our earnings derived from our management and franchising business in 2020."

Our attractive dividend yield combined with earnings growth from investments in our regulated utilities provides a strong risk-adjusted return for our shareholders."
1,"Before wrapping up, as many of you saw today, we announced an agreement with ST for the manufacture and supply of GaN on silicon wafers. This addresses the third and final leg of our GaN growth strategy, installing the requisite supply chain to bring GaN mainstream across all parts of the wireless base station market, 4G LTE as well as 5G.

At Simpson, we strive for excellence and we remain committed to our employees and their families, our shareholders, our customers and the community at large."

1,"Both of these metrics are well ahead of our medium-term IPO target. These strong results reflect continued execution against our strategic initiatives and our commitment to focus on continuous improvement to drive further revenue growth while maintaining operating expense discipline. On page 9, for the full year, we delivered underlying EPS growth of 34% with positive operating leverage of 6."
1,"Both of these virtually ensured that qualified customers would be exposed to your brand. Placement in select department stores and mall-based company-owned stores, still play a role in our overall strategy. However due to declining traffic in physical stores and malls as well as the struggles of the department store channel in general, they are not the potent customer acquisition tools that they once were."
1,"BP is in action with a clear strategy and a set of businesses that are focused on a lower carbon future. Our commitment to helping drive the energy transition is embedded in the core of our business strategy. The key for BP is for our strategy and our investment choices to remain flexible to a range of scenarios, scenarios which ultimately drive our four strategic priorities."
1,"Building manufacturing capacity is a core competency of Canada Goose and we have been doing so for many years. We invest aggressively and continuously and it is deeply embedded in our strategic planning process. This year across our manufacturing facilities, we expanded our sewer training program, secured additional space and introduced a number of lean and flexible manufacturing principles to increase efficiency, while maintaining our high quality standards."
1,Building that product portfolio and those future capabilities remains a critically important priority for all of us at Endo. We began this mission by undertaking an overall assessment of our company's strategy and its assets and product portfolios. We identified assets and businesses that were not core to us and divested them.
1,"Business development. Key part of our strategy is to expand the portfolio. We're in a unique position where we have the ability and the intent to pursue additional assets, but we really don't have the need to because, we've got so much on our plate right now."
1,"But a good performance in the year, a very good progress on our strategy execution and on implementation of our plans there, and also some help from a recovery of some of the CapEx-intensive end markets that we serve. The benefits of growth in 2018 we're seeing in top line 6%, 8% on an adjusted operating profit basis and some offset in the year on investment in the strategic initiatives, as well as some foreign exchange headwinds that we anticipated coming in 2018. Phase 1 of Uplift is well under way and delivering well."
1,"But as an outer circle, as a use of free cash flow that has to be on the table. But basically we're a software company that understood sticking to our strengths in our new strategic plan, growing whilst maintaining that strength that comprising the business model or the quality, taking advantage of sub-trends by the cloud, as we deploy more and more, become more of a trusted advisor as their journey becomes more complex with a wrapper about being conscious of creating total shareholder value for all the different stakeholders. Bit of a brain dump, I'm afraid, hope I didn't overrun."
1,"But as we commented on earlier, our plan for 2018 contemplates based on what we can see now, which is a continuation of what we delivered in 2017. Other than that, we will remain focused on our buyback strategy as another   as a sort of third or   yeah, third priority as it relates to the deployment of capital. And so, that's where we find ourselves."
1,"But during the half year, we did increase our equity holdings in both Peel and Catalyst to 16% each, which as we feel   but great prospective areas with a great team working on them and very interesting results. We've been working on our strategy and our strategic timeline is quite long but we're looking at our strategy of what we're trying to do in the next five years which is largely stronger for long run and what we're doing in Gwalia is a good example of that as we have announced today. Slide 20 outlines the pillars of our success there, not only are we looking for sustainable long life operations, extending Gwalia looking at what we can to do in PNG and adding to the portfolio inorganically to diversify our production base in gold and have more operations, more diversity there and a longer life."
1,"But first I'll start with page 21, FY 2018, strategic priorities. Thanks, Peter."
1,"But I actually think our performance since then has actually not been that dramatically different than the index, so I think more of it is overall sector sentiment. As you know, we think our business plan and the growth in the numbers that we've been setting out as far as our objectives, it's a robust plan and it takes into account a rising interest rate market and wider cap rates, et cetera, in all of our assumptions. We've been assuming that for a couple of years."
1,"But I also think it's important to recognize that the first dollars are still being controlled by the large commercial payors and are still being controlled by states and federal governments. And I think it's an important part of our strategy that needs to shift in terms of bringing in back into the fold. In terms of expanding our surgical centers, obviously, NSH was a big part of that."
1,"But I do think it's important to think there are quite a bit of differences between them. So one of the things, I guess, as we talk about our strategy is being a little bit more focused on perhaps the narrower set of initiatives. Opportunistically, we'll chase whole bunch of things that makes sense to us."
1,"But I really think of inorganic activity in terms of both capability expansion and portfolio expansion. So, as we continue to execute our strategy, we continue to differentiate what we do from the way things used to be done, and I also think our competitors will continue to look at inorganic activity predominantly in terms of expansion of the capabilities that we offer to our clients, and as a way to move our clients' footprint into other spaces. Potentially, we talked about federal civilian and again these next ones are just example, but you can take a look at municipalities, you can take a look at prison systems, you can take a look at some of the larger federal civilian agencies that have and deploy physical asset bases, any place where you see people kind of walking around with hard hats and digital devices, those are typically the sorts of things that we do very, very well in very austere environments all over the world."
1,"But I think it's a good conservative number. There is clearly some costs and expenditures rather in that $120 million, that is related to the ongoing synergy plans and also some of the CapEx plans that when Faiveley came over and they're executing their strategic plan that is continuing on. For example, where we invest in some plants in Eastern Europe and also in India and so those are kind of onetime, and I would expect that number to come down a little bit."
1,"But I think that during 2018, we'll begin to take steps in that direction, working side-by-side with our dealers for those that have the propensity to support their end customers more proactively around our subscription service. Another dimension of our strategy is to provide cloud services for monitoring homes and enabling our dealers with that. We have the BakPak service."
1,"But if I compare to the previous period, it's not an accounting effect. It's an effect due to the fact that we've changed our strategy. We're investing more in hardware, in existing clients; more flexible offers for new customers, for existing customers; hardware for discount customers and for portal customers."
1,"But if we don't, we're prepared to keep the business that generates significant contribution margins. Now, that we refined our business to his tech focus core and have the organization in place, we believe the execution of our strategy will continue to improve. Before I turnover to Luc, I want to give a quick update on the CEO search process."
1,"But if you go back 10 years and you look at what's happened, there's been a significant change in the tower landscape for the public companies where you have three companies with different strategies. And so, what would you highlight to the audience today in terms of maybe some of the underlying points of differentiation for your strategy that you feel maybe underappreciated or unnoticed?"
1,"But if you would see those numbers and compare that it will come in one or two years, it is not the case. So, it is a long-term plan and the clearances have been taken on that effect that it for a longer period what capacities and all you will need."
1,"But in a world where, at the moment, with a more difficult economic environment and with consumers focusing on the pound in their pocket and spending wisely, we know that for coffee and food, the combination of convenience, quality and value are the three keys. And we want to make sure that we are increasing our quality as we innovate increasing our convenience, as we manage our channel strategy to be more convenient, and managing that value proposition. And so, we will want to do some more interesting things with pricing as we go through the year."
1,"But in an uncertain and changing world, the key is for our strategy and our investment choices to be resilient to a range of future outcomes. Now as Bob outlined earlier, how we do that is by setting clear strategic priorities and vigorously pursuing these. We also of course consider the timing and implications of changing patterns of demand and use this to plan around distinct horizons."
1,"But in January, what we announced is simply we presented the impact of certain factors   the potential impact, but rather than in nominal terms, we simply presented the potential impact in terms of their impact on the KPIs. We haven't changed the level which is in our strategy implementation plan, which we expect to achieve in 2019, and that's 5. 1%, just to be fully clear."
1,"But is there room for more dividends or what   I also saw that you bought back some stock actually, so 1 million shares. So maybe you could quickly update us on your balance sheet strategy."
1,But let me follow up with two questions. OpEx actually   could you share with us a little bit your strategy for digital banking? How much   what percentage of your transactions already are done digitally and what you're thinking until 1the French opening?
1,"But like for example let's take I-O, there are many opportunities to make bets in I-O, much wider than any   no company can bet in all the possible areas in I-O. So, what we have done and when we've configured our strategy is to say what are some areas that are exciting to us, but where we also feel if we make a bet, there's value that we could add, there's synergy with our existing portfolio and we've started from there. So, there are areas where we just haven't bet because it's sort of   when we look at the opportunities, it's not clear that it synergizes with who we are, with our expertise and it would be, and it may or may not be a good thing to move in that direction."
1,"But obviously our discussions have gone well so far with payers, and we're laying the educational foundations such that when those peer reviews happen we've at least positioned all the appropriate people within the payer organizations to have already digested the information and, in fact, we can get back to them and answer any other questions they may have on the data even before the data gets published. So, that's our strategy here over the next six months."
1,"But obviously, we are   and we're very keen and we've said that many times, we do not want to go to new markets, so we would always look at end market transactions where we already have a presence. So at the moment, our strategy, as I said, would be organic, focused on organic growth. There could be expansion as I mentioned in my presentation briefly."
1,"But our focus now is on 2018 and beyond. As mentioned before, we have a number of strategic priorities to execute and we must remain disciplined on the cost front, while maintaining our philosophy of thoughtfully reinvesting back in the business to drive growth. We expect 2018 to be another great year for Floor & Decor, and we're confident in the team we have in place."
1,"But part of the plan is short   we will be communicated on shorter term. But regarding the international expansion of the strategic plan, that will be communicated in the next few months. So we will have different announcements regarding the different parts of the..."
1,"But Q4 showed several positive areas in terms of increased orders in all segments, improved cash flow and actions taken on key initiatives. We still have a long way to go but I'm confident of the course we have charted and excited about our 4-3-3 Operational Strategy and the prospects of improving markets. With that, I'll turn it back to Dennis."
1,"But so far as this instance is concerned it is basically going to be a regular affair. So it is basically a very strategic initiative that organizations take to build a strong base, so far as people part is concerned. I hope that answers your question?"
1,"But some of it should drop to the bottom line. So   and if you look at our five-year strategic plan which I know you can't but we can, it shows growth year-on-year in every one of our segments."
1,"But Suraj, it's a good question and one we are looking at and we are looking at other geographies, including ones that we're heavily invested to think can we start some pilot trials and experiments, some courageous experiments if you like of taking the Brightree technology to some of the other markets that we do business in. So I guess that's part of our horizon three strategy, that out of hospital software expansion. You'll see us talk more about that as we go forward."
1,But that really is kind of I'd refer to as sort of the background activity. Our number one job is BD and strategic priorities.
1,"But that totally depends on investment opportunities and the attractiveness of those capital deployment opportunities. Bottom line, our leverage is lower than we planned it to be, but that's consistent with the other aspects of our strategy."
1,"But the short story is new product is exceeding our expectations on almost every dimension. Now, let me turn to progress against our strategic initiatives beginning with the reinvention of our Mail business. Again, our new SendPro product is a digitally-connected product, based on an open platform that enables mailing, shipping and other third-party applications."
1,"But this doesn't represent like a sea change in your own capital deployment strategy, I guess for all the changes that has in the market and in your own cash flow, it doesn't sound like you guys are really pulling any more tools out of the box just yet?"
1,"But to the extent, we'll be   we're always selective in our acquisitions and but it hasn't changed our view on acquisition. We'll be aggressive on acquisitions, but they've got to fit our strategic plan. And our strategic plan is real simple it's got to be   it's either a profitable, well-managed, standalone business that fits our strategy or it's got to be a tuck-in where we can see we just find synergies and we can drive margins from synergy not through anything else other than that."
1,"But ultimately, it does not change our strategic directions nor our 2020 nor 2022 targets. In fact, our investments and strategy contribute towards building a solid foundation that supports our mission and our objectives. We are committed to becoming a renewed financial institution that is there to help customers improve their financial health, by combining the value of human advice, the ease of doing business and the convenience of digital transactions."
1,"But we are convinced that we could achieve the sales target of increasing the earnings as stated. So we're now seeing that we need really to present any additional strategic plan today, okay, even due to the acquisitions that are quite small, not transforming as the one that we had during the 2016, so the Interbanca Group. We are really concentrated in delivering results and executing today."
1,"But we don't tend to be the kind of company that reacts really quickly to ups and downs. We have a hedging program, we have long-term plans, we have long-term contracts. And so, at the present time, we plan no changes."
1,"But we need to leverage those projects and that track record to show repeatability, which means that we can acquire or negotiate partnerships with such similar projects, so we can grow our project portfolio. And I think very much as the feedback we're getting from the institutions is that that delivery of not only commissioning and running our current operations is shown to be profitable, but also to be able to grow that portfolio and demonstrate that we truly are running ahead of the pack is something that I think the market would be looking forward to Jubilee to show that our strategy that we're pursuing which is so large and so significant is, in fact, achievable."
1,"But what lies behind laying that statement is the kind of self-help operational improvement that was always a key part of the Events First strategy. And you may remember that when we launched it, we talked about five strategic priorities that are laid out across the top. And we have continued to work assiduously on programs in support of those priorities."
1,"But with all that we saw going on around this, we felt it was important that we began to think about really structurally transforming the business to take advantage of what we believe will be a future opportunities to build a sustainable business, three years, five years and 10 years from now. And so executive management and our board approved a new strategic initiative which we're referring to as Simplify and Grow. It's about how do we enhance the customer experience, how we accelerate revenue growth, how do we simplify our organization, and our processes to drive efficiency and effectiveness."
1,"But you're right, it is an important part of the future development of coal, and we are absolutely determined to be leading exponents of top coal caving and have an ability to handle ever increasing geotechnical problems with less disruption than we suffered in this case. So, as you can see, over the past six months, our long-term plans   they have delivered solid results despite some several one-off issues that Peter referred to. And they're largely behind us."
1,"But, Dan, maybe start just kind of talk about some high level things and your strategy over the last couple of years has really been driven looking at focus and market leadership in key areas in driving innovation and kind of improving the portfolio to have things that are necessary to your customers. So let's talk a little bit about how you've been driving that."
1,"But, in short, here's what you should take away from this announcement. First, this transaction is consistent with our growth and diversification strategy. While Granite is an established leader in the transportation market, since our acquisition of Kenny Construction in 2012, we have been looking for ways to expand our presence and strengthen our capabilities in the attractive water and wastewater markets."
1,"But, you know, the reality is that, yes, it's easier for us to bring the cash back, but as we mentioned before, we're managing the company conservatively from a cash perspective and using it to invest in our healthcare and PMT growth strategies, primarily which we're starting to results of and we expect that with the CT tube coming that we're going to see even better results in the quarters ahead. So, I wouldn't say that as Ed said in his remarks, we're not planning any changes to our dividend or stock buyback strategy, but we are going to continue the dividend which is what we've been doing subject of course to current market conditions."
1,"But, you started off your comments by saying you spent first 90 days of your tenure in store. So, does that imply from your strategic plan that you're seeing challenges in both customer acquisition and customer retention, and where is the bigger opportunity?"
1,"By 2020, we expect that revenue contribution from industrial Internet will reach about 15%. For strategic cooperation, the company will actively push forward in-depth cooperation with investors, based on future strategic plan and resources advantages, we formed powerful alliance with our investors and entered into innovative cooperation. Making good use of the online sales touch points of Internet companies, we acquired about 50 million 2I2C subscribers at low cost."
1,"By acquiring Juno, their broad platforms with CAR-T and TCR, world-class scientists, and novel therapies, we immediately solidify our long-term commitment in this space. We continue to aggressively execute on our strategy of adding late-stage assets and bringing medical innovation to patients worldwide. JCAR017, together with BGB-A317 and fedratinib, represents the third late-stage asset acquired in the past nine months."
1,"By big buckets by region, so most of those stores were in Asia, 50 on a net basis, Europe is still a very important region for us, and I'll show you why in about a minute, 48 stores. France, our network declined, and that's our strategy, all right. Our strategy for the network in France, which I'll describe just a little bit later is to optimize the store network, and we have 475 stores in France."
1,"By fundamentally changing the way we do business, we'll gain the strength and flexibility to be successful regardless of the market conditions we faced. We're fully committed to this strategy and I'm confident that it'll enable us to deliver our objectives by becoming a leaner, less capital intensive, higher-margin and lower-debt company, will ultimately return to an investment-grade rating and create sustainable value for all of our shareholders. With that, thank you."
1,"By refocusing 100% of the company's resources around Hyperscale and Hybrid Colocation, removing complexity in the business related to our C3 cloud products and aligning our cost structure to be a more efficient business model, we expect to achieve improved leasing performance and revenue growth with higher profitability and less volatility that can ultimately deliver enhanced long-term OFFO per share growth and performance. I know we ran a little longer than usual this morning, but we thought it was important to discuss in detail some of the details behind our strategic initiatives in 2018. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning."
1,"By the end of FY 2018, we would have concluded this cost-out program and delivered the AUD 13 million to AUD 15 million of savings a year ahead of schedule. We will host another Investor Market Briefing in April 2018, and we look forward to sharing further details of our strategy, including future cost-out targets with you. I'm on slide 20."
1,"Can I find one, maybe, but maybe not? So it's   it is a white space, it would be   it would be a strategic initiative. But we are not crazy about it, so if I can't find a way to do it, we've got other places to deploy the capital."
1,"Can we queue up question number five, this is valuation, in your opinion what multiple of 2018 earnings should see in trades less than 10, 10 to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 18, 19 to 21? Why have you   I just want to close out with one more question, really surrounding your intermodal growth strategy, which we talked about in throughput Vancouver has a lot of expansion. But then if I could also weave in a question just around NAFTA because obviously that's a political issue that's probably not going away anytime soon."
1,Can you hear me now? I was asking about your investment plan as part of your strategic plan. You mentioned a slippage of around 10% of investments.
1,"Capital discipline remains essential to our company's philosophy. Our long-term plan is to continue to increase our rig count to about 16 rigs within cash flow, and then begin generating significant free cash. We believe at a certain point in a company's lifecycle, it should generate a return on capital in excess of its cost of capital, and subsequently return capital to its stakeholders."
1,"Carve it out, shape the transactions, and John could talk about how he's doing this, but really work them patiently and get to opportunities whether it's on the divestment side or the investment side. That is really as good as they can get, the same as with organic opportunities and fits our strategy and where there's remaining value creation potential that we consider to be a meaningful value creation proposition for our shareholders. Otherwise, we could sort of distribute the spend."
1,"Cash grew slightly in the fourth quarter. Maintaining cash at strong levels will allow us the freedom to continue to execute on our transformation strategy in 2018 and provide flexibility to increase resources to grow our business. Now, turning to brief overview of the fourth quarter and full year financial results."
1,"Category two is opportunistically invest to grow. These products are important components in our product strategy and represent 30% of company revenues and our next highest returning product lines. And our Food and Beverage systems, ClydeUnion Pumps, and industrial heat exchangers represent 30% of revenue where we are focused on enhancing performance."
1,"Celgene's belief in these programs and conviction in our capabilities to target diseases driven by abnormal forms of protein will help us advance potentially disease-modifying therapies across several neurodegenerative diseases. As such, this collaboration supports our overall strategy by significantly accelerating our ability to put our extensive expertise in this space to work to advance a diverse pipeline. The global collaboration includes three novel neurodegenerative targets."
1,"Certainly, fiscal 2018 is growing, and each quarter, we've been showing and displaying an accelerated level of that year-over-year expansion, so that's going to provide some earnings leverage there. And I'd say, if you step back, the other strategic initiative that we've been hyper-focused on and very disciplined about where we invest as a company and position ourselves has been around driving greater Sketch-to-Scale penetration, and that's being led by having more meaningful design and engineering technology content in our offerings, and the results of which will reflect in future revenues of greater margin carry. So in several instances, you're also seeing a shift from creating and ramping and development of these initiatives into a scaling and expanding."
1,"Certainly, from a learning perspective, it just reinforced what we've been chasing; chasing the customer, and where they lead us. We invested significantly to eliminate a lot of friction between the different channels as we pursue our One Home Depot strategy, investing in expertise, in knowledge and the online property. You'll see more of that in 2018 with similar growth aspirations."
1,"CFO, Glenn Maclnnes and I will review the quarter, and then HSA Bank President, Chad Wilkins, will join us to take questions. We continue to make significant progress against our key strategic initiatives, aggressively growing HSA Bank, expanding our Commercial Banking activities, and optimizing and transforming Community Banking. And as we look forward, we remain optimistic for Webster's continued growth and strengthening financial performance, both as a result of our differentiated businesses and because we see a favorable operating environment in 2018."
1,"CHF 220 million, it was the last indication. We're in the middle of doing our bottom up strategic plan now that will be presented to the board in June. By the mid-year, we'll come back to you with more clarity."
1,"Chris Huskilson, President and Chief Executive Officer, and other members of the management team at Emera will respond to questions. This morning, Scott will discuss the results from operations and our strategic initiatives, and Greg will provide an overview of the financial results. We expect the presentation segment to last about 15 minutes, after which, we will be happy to take questions from analysts."
1,"Clarity on tax policies removed the drag on large cap M&A. In every sector, the new tax laws are spurring discussions on capital structure and strategic planning. In Europe, an improving economy is raising growth forecast, driving increased confidence in M&A activity."
1,"Clarity. Clarity is the most important aspect of this strategic plan. Having businesses with clarity on where they are heading, who know that they have the resources to get there and that they will be held accountable for delivering, that's what clarity means."
1,"Clearly, 2017 was a noteworthy one for Ingevity. We executed our operating and strategic plans well, orchestrated a marked turnaround in our Performance Chemicals segment, maintained strong growth in our Performance Materials business, leveraged the new lower cost structure we created in 2016 and delivered outstanding financial results. On revenues that increased 7%, we drove an adjusted EBITDA increase of 20% and achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of 25% of sales, representing an increase of 270 basis points."
1,"Clearly, 2017 was a year of transition for SemGroup. We executed on our strategic plan of simplifying our business and adding stable cash-flowing assets with growth prospects to our portfolio. I'll talk more about our outlook for 2018 in a few minutes."
1,"Clearly, at any one point in time, it's going to get skewed, based on maybe an accelerated pace at a point in time. But the long-term plan still 50-50. It's the healthiest place for the business to be."
1,"CMS organic revenue growth was 3% in the quarter and we expect to continue to deliver low single-digit growth in 2018 normalized for the boiler code. Moving on to our synergies and strategic initiatives, we had made substantial progress with our cost synergy program and will surpass our initial $125 million target this year. We plan to incrementally invest additional synergies in four strategic areas that we laid out at our April Investor Day."

Our second and third strategic priorities, creating better experiences for consumers and evolving our revenue models to align with industry success, hinge on our ability to enable more transactions for consumers and our advertisers. Let me now connect the dots across a few important initiatives starting with our Premier Agent business, which taken as a whole demonstrate how we are moving further down funnel and, ultimately, helping our advertisers improve their conversion."

We're off to a strong start and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress throughout the year."

As we look ahead, we believe we're in a very solid position with a major global product launch slated for later this year and multiple strategic initiatives moving forward. More on these key programs in a moment, but now I will turn the call over to Quentin for a review of our financials."

Ultimately, the net impact of the tax benefits to EPS is expected to be between $0."

Our strategy of advancing both VX-659 and VX-445 into Phase 3 gives us the opportunity to generate data from two different triple combination regimens, including one that maybe dosed once daily, and pick the best regimen to bring to patients as quickly as possible. Our discussions with the FDA regarding our Phase 3 program for triple combination regimens have been productive, and we have already shared with the FDA the available data for the VX-659 and VX-445 triple combination regimens."

And I know you're going to wait until midyear to discuss the next several years around the strategic plan. But I was hoping you could comment at least on whether you think MondelÄ“z has underspent against its brands or business to any significant degree that might require a more sizable step up, let's say, in 2019 and beyond, or if it's more just about focusing the spending that you're already doing in a more effective way going forward."

1,"Even after the dividend is being paid out and the free cash flow that we are generating, we also looked at what will be the right size of a share buyback program, and that's where we settled. Given the underlying improvements, not just of the business, as part of our Creating the New strategy or the execution of Creating the New strategy, of course, that success will generate cash as well every year.

1,"First of all, well, I think that after spending these couple of hours together I think it's clear that this moment, this presentation is extremely important for us. We finalized the Restructuring Plan and when we completed it, we completed one of our life stage in Bankia we could say where we've had defined a Strategic Plan and a Restructuring Plan and I think that is important to share with you and you know this that despite all the circumstances, despite the context, the macro environment that has been very different to what was expected in 2012, I think it's important to say that we have managed to meet all the goals that we set ourselves for this period and that is the case. But now we have to look at the future, a future that starts now, a future that in our opinion is an stage for growth where we have total freedom of management of future."

1,"For 2018, we expect our capital expenditures will be in the range of $15 million to $20 million. So wrapping up, as Martin said earlier, we made really great progress on key strategic initiatives in 2017 and we're starting to see the benefits of those initiatives this year.

1,"For all kinds of categories of retail service providers in the marketplace, it's that kind of   time of season. I don't think it's right for me to comment on our competitive pricing promotion strategy as an organization. I think it's on the sensitive base of thinking."
1,"For ConocoPhillips, our value proposition is an approach to the E&P business that's aimed at delivering predictable performance and superior returns through cycles, not chasing the cycles. Our strategy works when prices are below $50 per barrel, like they were for much of 2017 or $60-plus per barrel like they are right now. Our value proposition is focused on creating long-term value and winning back both energy and generalist investors to a sector that has underperformed for far too long."
1,"For EMEA, we are targeting significant improvement in our operating results in fiscal 2019 compared to the $14 million operating loss in 2018, which you'll recall was comprised of a $2 million loss in the second half of the year and a $12 million loss in the first half of the year, which included a $4 million property gain. Taking into consideration, our objectives to grow the top line and further improve our gross margins, as well as the seasonality of our business and the recently strengthened euro, we expect to report an operating loss for the first half of the year and operating income in the second half of the year. Those results will depend on our ability to sustain organic revenue growth and drive additional improvements in our gross margin, as we are continuing to target relatively flat operating expense in constant currency and adjusted for the property gain in the prior year."
1,"For every individual share, it's grown by more than 9% the level of SIAS and by more than 4% at the level of ASTM. Here too, we have a target disclosed to the market because 7% of CAGR 2017, 2021, which is the one present in the Strategic Plan, I mean, we are flexible as you can see in the sense that this year too we have increased at the level of SIAS where we have the availability also our results   the results for the S. p."

1,"For me, it's about the pipeline, in these five strategic priorities, new, they're emerging. We've got to do a better job of how we tell the story and how people can value it and understand the milestones but I think the fact that we've probably got one of the strongest pipelines in the med tech industry and certainly of any of the small cap, in small to mid-cap companies is one of the   is that I think are underappreciated."

In the latter part of 2017, we kicked off strategic initiatives to integrate Superior ID and HPI, leveraging the strengths of each group to create a stronger, more efficient organization.

1,"For the Industrial Group, we're seeing increased opportunities in MRO work and we expect these to grow as we capitalize on our ability to fully self-perform all trades in the province.

For the Buildings Group, infrastructure spending has been delayed, but is beginning to roll out and we'll be focused on building market share in our regions."
1,"For the last several years, we've exceeded one or both of those targets while prudently investing in future growth opportunities. Because we will generate a sizable recurring earnings boost from the reduction in our corporate tax rate from 42% in fiscal 2017 to 29% to 30% starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we've decided to opportunistically reinvest a portion of these savings to accelerate some strategic initiatives. These included additional build-out of business banking and C&I lending teams, IT and other infrastructure investments, marketing and rebranding initiatives for the bank and our consumer brands, and opportunistic additions of senior level talent."
1,"For the quarter, we achieved strong organic sales growth and improved profitability. We are executing our strategic plan that includes growth initiatives for solution selling at higher margins. We're driving our business to sell total solutions with a deep understanding of our customers' needs."

1,"For the year, net debt was reduced by CAD 171 million, bringing the total for the last 24 months to more than CAD 330 million of debt reduction. At the end of the third quarter, we announced our intentions to move forward with a multiyear strategic plan designed to capture the opportunities within our current operating platform and to pursue further opportunities for growth. This plan is entirely consistent with the strategy we've employed on a number of occasions in the past, most recently in the B."

Let's start with our enterprise customers."
1,"Four of five segments again delivered strong volume growth, led by nearly 20% growth in Engineering Adhesives. Asia Pacific delivered about 10% growth, with Americas Adhesives and EIMEA delivering mid-single-digit volume growth, all stronger than our long-term plans. Acquisitions contributed 3% to growth, while foreign exchange and mix netted to zero."
1,"Fourth quarter average unit price growth of approximately 3% partially offset some continued softness from lower order intake. Our strategy for the Architectural business was to treat 2017 as a transition year, resetting our plant footprint, reconfiguring our product portfolio and harmonizing product specifications. And with these important steps now largely behind us, our focus turns to improving the customer experience and resuming volume growth in 2018."
1,"From fiscal 2018 forward, our current best estimate of an effective tax rate is the high 20% range as we take into consideration the 21% federal tax rate as well as partial offsets such as executive compensation limits and international taxes. As Melissa mentioned, we expect to reinvest a good portion of these tax savings to further our strategic priorities. We'll share more information on our fourth quarter call in May, when we provide our fiscal 2018 outlook."

1,"Front of house with engineering and sales is now over 80% of the people of the company. That's by design, and so really those remain our strategic priorities. We're going to be focusing hiring, to your point, as we move forward, but those remain high priorities for us."
1,"Full year operating profit is expected to be ahead of consensus, but within the range of current market forecast. Finally, to comment on our outlook for the first quarter and the year ahead, our strategy to invest in our large, high potential markets remains unchanged, and we are pleased that we're seeing strong growth in all five of these markets. We will continue to diversify in the U."
1,"funds. Now, the flows in a preferred strategy are still larger than the others, but the new flows or the flows that are now positive that weren't previously were into our real asset portfolio, into our MLP portfolio, very importantly into our low-duration preferred strategy. And what that reflects is   and we're seeing and actually discussing actively with our relationships the pros and cons of switching out of our global preferred, which has a longer duration into our low-duration preferred fund, and that obviously wasn't an accident."
1,"Further, as Brian will detail later, originated loan growth was even stronger after adjusting for specific targeted reductions. Perhaps no better indicator of the success of our client relationship manager strategy is our low-cost transaction deposits were also growing at a double-digit rate during 2017 as we captured the operating accounts of our clients. Our bank's credit metrics improved in virtually every category, and we expect these positive trends to continue."
1,"Further, in-country consolidation is resulting in a better industry structure, which is a welcome step given the relatively smaller scale of individual countries. Against this backdrop, let me reiterate our five-pronged strategy. Firstly, grab and retain high ARPU customers; second, provide more services per customer; third, create a brilliant customer experience; fourth, accelerate non-mobile businesses; and, fifth, a war on waste to hold costs."
1,"Furthermore, with the addition of AG Florida's customer base, we have another market to introduce our professional services that we believe can help them more effectively serve their customers and better compete. Regarding the third prong of our Wholesale strategy, we continue to add new customers both in existing and new markets. In fact, in this growing global economy and as more countries and consumers seek American-made products, we're excited by the possibilities for growth."
1,"FX-neutral revenue per case grew by 6. 9% in the period, in line with our strategy to implement pricing initiatives in markets facing inflationary pressures and currency headwinds. It is pleasing to see that both category and packaged mix also supported value."
1,"GAAP financial measures, provide useful informational for both management and investors by excluding certain non-cash and other expenses that are not indicative of our core operating results. Management uses non-GAAP measures to compare our performance relative to forecasts and strategic plans to benchmark our performance externally against competitors and for certain compensation decisions. Reconciliations between U."
1,"Gas and then Power will be the next largest contributors, with these two representing about half of total corporate EBITDA. Our strategic plan remains the same, create meaningful growth in each of our three business lines and that has not changed with the WGL transaction. Over the next few years, we see significant defined growth opportunities in each business that in total sum to over CAD 5 billion."
1,"Given our strong cash flow generation capabilities, the momentum across our business, and the benefits associated with tax reform, we have confidence that we can reduce our debt by at least $1 billion annually, and we now expect to achieve our 2x leverage milestone exiting the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018. And once we achieve this leverage ratio, we will revisit our capital allocation strategy to ensure that we continue to optimize shareholder value. So now, let's discuss the quarter."
1,"Given the opportunities set in front of us, we will be investing a further $10 million in new hires and bids during 2018. While this might result in near-term pressure on our profitability, we consider this to be an important foundation for our future as we implement our strategic initiatives. Our bid pipeline stands at $3."
1,"Given the volatility of the markets, given the competitive pressures, of course, we, when possible, seek to take price. And that remains our strategy. That having been said, since we haven't communicated to the market our pricing strategy, and that is a strategic element, I'm not going to comment further on that."
1,Glad you got through that cough and made it all the way through. So I'd like to highlight three strategic initiatives that have an impact on the 2018 guidance that Gerry just provided. These initiatives will also have a long run   they enhance our long run objective of enhancing operating income and EBITDA.
1,"Going forward, each Group President will be responsible for a single geographic region and have one global brand reporting to them. Reshaping the portfolio is the number one choice in our strategy and we were very active in 2017. Our commitment to active portfolio management is how we position ourselves to deliver top quartile returns, with an evolving portfolio of powerful brands that are strategically advantaged to win."
1,"Going forward, we have a lot more degrees of freedom as to how we may do our structuring of transactions. I think to your question in terms of does it change our strategy, I'd say no. And I think our strategy continues to be focused on scientific differentiation, et cetera."
1,"Good afternoon from Italy, good evening to Asia, and good morning to America. Our outlook, the recent performance of the group is the result of our strategic initiatives aimed at meeting customer expectations while respecting the iconic heritage of our world-renowned brand, that's the Prada way to compete in the current fast-changing environment. We'll continue to nurture our creativity with our unique way to observe a contemporary society and to interpret market trends."
1,"Good afternoon, everybody. The bottom line is that we are on track for the fiscal year and our long-term plans. Additionally, we expect to benefit from continued M&A related activity and changes to our tax situation."
1,"Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin by reviewing the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year performance and then discuss the progress on our strategic initiatives and thoughts on the coming fiscal year. Kevan will then go over our financial results in more detail and review our outlook, after which we will open up the call to your questions."
1,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining in on today's call. We are pleased to report improving results for the quarter ended December 31 of 2017, led by our Canadian operations and new customer wins in connection with our strategy of bundling value-added warehouse solutions with our core transportation service offering. We posted adjusted EBITDA of $7."
1,Good evening. I just wanted to understand on our Noida strategy   Noida and Greater Noida strategy. We have   we've sold almost close to 3 million square feet in the last five to six quarters in our Greater Noida and Noida launches.
1,"Good morning and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings conference call. On the call today, Ed Tilly, our Chairman and CEO, will discuss the quarter and provide an update on our strategic initiatives; then Brian Schell, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will provide an overview of our fourth quarter 2017 financial results and guidance for certain financial metrics for 2018. Following their comments, we will open the call to Q&A."
1,"Good morning and welcome to Farmland Partners' fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call and webcast. We appreciate you taking the time to join these calls because it gives management a chance to share our thinking and our strategy in a format less formal and more interactive than public filings and press releases. During today's comments, I will be speaking to both our supplemental Q4 2017 supplemental and to the Q4 2017's earnings call slides."
1,Good morning to everyone on the call and to those listening on the Internet. The fourth quarter was a solid finish to a year that saw important progress on several strategic initiatives and showcased ATI's longer term financial potential. The ATI team worked diligently to achieve our financial and operational goals to build a sustainably profitable business which can consistently create value for our shareholders and customers and opportunity for our employees.
1,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings conference call, particularly given the early time of our call, due to a number of CPG companies releasing earnings later this morning. As we will provide an update on our strategic initiatives at the CAGNY Conference on Wednesday, our scripted comments this morning will be focused on third quarter results and our full year outlook. Mark Smucker, President and CEO and Mark Belgya, Vice Chair and CFO will provide our prepared comments."
1,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call. I'm delighted to report that 2017 was a record year for Air Canada, underscoring the effectiveness of our transformation strategy, our global expansion and the power of our comprehensive network. The numerous financial records we set last year, following on the previous year's results, are further evidence that our strategy is succeeding in transforming Air Canada into a company that can be consistently and sustainably profitable over the long term."
1,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and 2017 year-end update. I will recap our latest results and share our objectives for 2018. Oded will follow with details on our financials and guidance."
1,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. I'm pleased to report a very solid finish to 2017 and another strong year for Blackbaud as we furthered our strategic initiatives, strengthened the company's financial profile, achieved our full-year financial guidance and delivered against our long-term aspirational goals. Our cloud solutions powered by Blackbaud SKY continued to lead the industry scoring high marks with market researchers like Forrester, Gartner and IDC."
1,"Good morning, everyone. As Tony highlighted, 2017 benefited from the successful completion of several strategic initiatives, some of which were initiated in early 2016. These initiatives were designed to eliminate excess manufacturing and logistical costs, exit high cost production facilities and allow us to better serve our customers for the longer-term."
1,"Good morning, everyone. On earnings call last quarter, I provided details on the steps we were taking to refine and clarify our overall strategic plan of how we allocate our capital across the organization and to better position the company for growth. As we are now in the first quarter of 2018, we have completed our staff reduction, the consolidation of 25 branches in the fourth quarter, in addition to the 13 we consolidated in the third quarter of 2017, discontinued our title insurance services and completed our reduction of resources to indirect auto lending."
1,"Good morning. This is a bit of a follow-on on the spend that you've got as part of the strategic initiatives, restructuring Leapfrog, opening of centers, so I guess this is more around what that total amount will look like, including CapEx from a point of view of what it does to your debt balances going forward?"
1,"Google Pay turns out to be an important part of all of this. As we move from just answers to helping users complete actions over time, including transactions, the ability to complete the transaction is an important part of it, and which is why making sure Google Pay in a unified way works as seamlessly as possible is a big part of our long-term strategy."
1,"government in a civilian agency to provide Stealth licenses, services and maintenance to facilitate the agency's use of physical and behavioral biometrics systems. As we have mentioned previously, partnerships have become an increasingly important part of our strategy with Stealth. During 2017, Mitel integrated our Stealth product into their secure cloud solution and closed their first sale of the combined offering to a large European manufacturer."
1,Grace's growth plan is to grow faster in all four of these segments and I'm going to explain how we're going to do that. It's really with four strategic initiatives. The first is the length between our PP licensing and our catalysts synergy.
1,"Great. So then, as it relates to the out years, just looking out longer term, is it safe to say perhaps the longer-term expectation for the organic growth for the business is around 3% to 5% like this year or perhaps, Phil, with the new strategic plan you're eyeing on, are there new opportunities to accelerate that revenue growth?"
1,"Greenbrier is off to a very good start in fiscal 2018. We believe this demonstrates the benefits of our strategy to concentrate on our core North American business while expanding internationally. Today, we are affirming our goal of $4 per share for fiscal 2018 with weighting in the second half."
1,"Growing energy sales and O&M, work is improving our visibility and profitability. We intend to continue to execute on our strategy in 2018 and beyond to look forward to another year of solid results. Thank you for your attention this morning."
1,"growth will drive global customer base growth of approximately 20%. In 2018, our commercial teams will focus on three key strategic initiatives. One is to secure widespread Medicare pharmacy coverage for Omnipod starting in 2019 and to expand Omnipod coverage through the pharmacy channel with Medicaid and existing commercial payers."
1,"GSR3 represents an exciting opportunity for us. And our entire management team and the senior leadership team across the group are energized, committed and determined to delivering across the four priorities of this strategic plan. And we are confident that delivery of this ambition will translate into greater value for our shareholders, as outlined in our revised financial targets."
1,"has led to our double-digit growth over the last nine years. Now, let me briefly outline our key strategic priorities and share our goals for 2018. As a reminder, our priorities are new store growth, increasing comparable store sales growth, expanding the connected customer experience, and continuing to invest in the Pro customer."
1,"Have you had any updated thoughts on your long-term margin outlook for this business? Quite obviously, you talked about the utilization gains you've seen in this half and the strategic priorities to improve that, but how does that translate into margins? And secondly, can you provide any updates on the payment those withheld from the Fox-IT previous principals?"
1,"Havells of course is a significant player, right. And we see ourselves if we're going to meet our objectives are continuing to build our premium position and continue to build our leadership position then we see ourselves moving forward, growing at a faster rate than they do on times."
1,"Having a reliable technology platform like TRiM gives us far more product development opportunities than we can currently move forward ourselves. Because of this, one of our key strategic priorities is to seek development partners for some of our programs and retain global rights for others. As I mentioned, we see ARO-APOC3 and ARO-ANG3 as potentially attractive partner programs at some point."
1,"Having a self-service platform so that a news broadcaster or an individual can post their content without having to speak to somebody, get help from customer support or so on is going to reduce friction and get more on the platform that we might otherwise have. So, we think about video as a lot of different things and we hope that what differentiates Twitter is that it's part of our broader strategy of helping people stay informed about the things that they care about in the world, helping them discuss what matters, and helping them inform others about what matters. But video should be thought about in the context of all those things, and live video should be thought about in the context of video in the context of the broader mission."
1,"Heimo Scheuch will open the call with a summary of the key developments of 2017. After that he will speak about our outlook as well as our strategic priorities. Following the opening statement, we will take questions."
1,"Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us this afternoon. Today we'll be highlighting our results for the quarter ended December 31 and sharing information on the progress we've made across our strategic priorities. Our highest priority remains achieving success with our regulatory initiative aimed at modernizing the 900 megahertz band."
1,"Herb will turn to cost synergies and the combination that that presents later in the call. Now, I will provide a short update on our continued progress against the three strategic initiatives that we've discussed over the last several earnings calls. I'll start with sales transformation."
1,"Here, our enhanced assortments in both bridal and fashion categories supported by targeted marketing and promotional strategies led to comp sales growth of 4%. The encouraging progress on our strategic priorities was significantly tempered, however, by the softness experienced at our Sterling banner stores, primarily driven by the credit outsourcing transition which accounted for roughly two-thirds of overall declines. Over the past three months, we've been working tirelessly to fix every identifiable issue."
1,"Hey, good morning, guys. Sam, you talked about expanding the outpatient sites as part of your CapEx strategy. How should we think about what the outpatient strategy is, meaning what areas should we be looking at in terms of where the capital is going and how do you view that in the grand scheme of things as the healthcare environment changes with United growing out, MedExpress and Walgreens facilities and CVS Aetna as well?"
1,"HFF uses expenditures as investments to support the future growth of the firm. In keeping with the firm's long-term strategic plan, we will continue to add personnel to our offices, property verticals and business lines throughout 2018, subject to the overall performance of the U. S."
1,"Historically, you parsed out the top line growth into innovation of product growth and emerging markets and service as part of your strategy to partner more with the hospitals."
1,"However, as Doug will discuss more fully in his comments, we have some optimism that pricing environment may improve in 2018 and our disciplined approach to underwriting and pricing will serve us very well as the market pivots. We also advanced a number of strategic initiatives in Commercial Lines that continue to strengthen our value proposition and extend our competitive advantages. For example, in Small Commercial, we continue to innovate with an ever-improving agent and customer experience."
1,"However, strong cash flow performance was underpinned by strong production from our Vietnam and Indonesian assets. In closing, slide 33, our strategic priorities for 2018 remain focused on driving shareholder value by being a low cost, reliable and high performance business. While we've made significant progress on our transformation journey in 2017, there is still more to do to reduce costs even further, improve efficiency and maximize operating cash flow."
1,"However, that trend accelerated in the third quarter faster than we forecasted. Ultimately, the transactions we closed, some of which Greg referenced, are proof our Enterprise strategy is working. You can see the strength of our business in implied billings growth, deferred revenue and cash flow."
1,"However, there will be some volatility in sales levels along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution and various other factors that come with building out a new product line. Strategic initiative number three is to broaden the product and revenue base. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the recognized strengths of WD-40 Company to derive revenue from existing brands as well as from new sources and products."
1,"However, we do expect new client originations in the initiatives we're undertaking in 2018 to build the foundation for growth that is expected to resume in 2019. And after 2019, we continue to believe and remain confident that, if we execute on our strategic plan, we can achieve mid to long-term growth rates of 7% to 9% in our business. We'll provide more details on our fourth quarter results and plans for 2018 on our next earnings conference call scheduled for March 15."
1,"However, we had to make some difficult decisions. We developed a strategic plan focusing on not filling positions vacated through attrition and the reduction of overtime, while carefully monitoring our head count. In the second half of the year, we ended all temporary work assignments and, in January 2018, we consolidated and eliminated approximately 60 indirect labor positions."
1,"However, we truly believe that we are making substantial progress towards the launch of the Huttig-Grip initiative as we fully transition into the sales execution stage. We continue to remain focused on executing our strategy, and based on our growth in the first two months of 2018, we believe we will continue to make progress throughout the balance of the year. Now, we'll take questions."
1,"I   probably, probably not. And probably, in a world where it might affect our strategy, we have a bunch of other positive things going for us. But it certainly is going to be a little bit of a drag on the company in a high price   in a high WCS price environment."
1,"I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers, partners and employees for making 2017 a great year. We achieved many significant milestones in 2017 and are well positioned to continue delivering on our commitments and executing against our strategic plans. Before I go to details on the fourth quarter, I'd like to provide a few highlights for the full year."
1,"I am also firmly committed to preserving a sound balance sheet. In this context, we are going to pursue the deployment of our projects within the framework of Trust Together and as I announced in January via a new five-year strategic plan. This medium-term plan to be unveiled in the coming months will enable Air France-KLM to build on its strength and regain their leadership position in the global air transport industry."
1,"I am also pleased to announce that we exceeded the upper end of our 2017 outlook ranges for net income, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. We achieved our objectives in 2017, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and generating significant distribution coverage. We ended the year with a total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3."
1,I am extremely excited about 2018 and the opportunities we have in front of us. We expect revenue growth in the mid-single digit as our disciplined growth strategy continues to gain momentum. We will continue to drive productivity improvement and will continue to benefit from operating leverage thanks to high incremental margins.
1,"I am extremely proud of what our team accomplished in 2017. Although the unforeseen events associated with the hurricanes negatively impact our results in the short-term, we are well-positioned to continue to successfully execute on our strategic plan in 2018 and beyond. The key pillar of the plan is growing VO sales as well as related club, management, and consumer financing revenue."
1,"I am proud of our progress to date in our innovation-focused investment strategy to develop open and flexible solutions that can be adapted to meet the needs of any client. We believe that pursuing a healthy mix of acquisitions that align with our strategic priorities in combination with investments in organically-driven innovation is the right approach for us to deliver market-leading capabilities to clients that will foster sustainable growth. Now, I'd like to cover some operational highlights starting with new business bookings and retention, both of which continued to show progress and stability against our expectations."
1,"I am proud that LifePoint continues to be considered a buyer of choice for many community-based hospitals and that's because of our focus on quality and the size and scale that we bring to any new acquisition. The pipeline is strong, but our strategy remains the same. We are highly selective in our acquisition candidates."
1,"I am utilizing my first 90 days as CEO, this being day 51 as a time to assess all of the businesses at Cowen. As such, we are engaged in a strategic review that will enable us to recalibrate our strategic priorities. Our expectation is that our ultimate decisions will bring greater consistency and transparency in our businesses and ultimately sustain profitability for our shareholders and employees alike."
1,"I am very pleased with our results so far this year which has resulted from all the hard work done over the past several years to strengthen and diversify our business. In addition, I'm excited for the new fiscal year, especially given our strategic initiatives which provide us with the opportunities to continue investing in profitable growth for years to come. And with that, we'd like to take your questions."
1,"I believe this acquisition materially enhances our distribution and management capabilities in the North American market, whilst also being financially attractive from day one. The second strategic initiative is the acquisition of Airlie Funds Management. I could not be more excited about the bringing together of Magellan and Airlie."
1,"I can absolutely confirm I think. Together, we will drive, so to say, our strategy going forward, our connected commerce strategy and the other falls pretty naturally, so to say, how we divide the work, yeah. So I think we are pretty good aligned on that one, yeah."
1,"I can only imagine. I just wanted to talk for a minute about Latin America, going back to this new capacity that's coming online in the market there, and really revisit your Crown's strategy in Brazil, because if I look back at, I think, the last major facility you added in Brazil, if I'm correct, was in 2014, and you had added sort of ahead of the market growth just given the growth profile there. What's sort of the go-forward strategy there?"
1,"I can't really say that, if between the different years, that that is exactly right   that I can't do. But if I look at the planning cycle, if I look at our strategy scenarios and we have many of them like, of course, you have to have when you look at three to five years then, I think, this is a good estimate of the overall markets in this period and the growth rate that we see. But without going into what, I believe, if it's right between individual years, so to speak."
1,"I described in I think the   in an earlier call, it might have been the last call when we first started talking about Zio AT that we have a launch team if you will that is responsible for helping us to target counts, train people, et cetera. But the long-term plan is we just turn all that over to sales reps   to the regular sales reps that we have. We didn't want to distract the core team with \\""the shiny new object\\"" if you will, given that the XT business is 90% of the market opportunity for us."
1,I do think it's in the $150 million to $200 million range going forward. I'm very excited about our cash flow generation and our ability to generate kind of a fair amount of cash to fund our strategic initiatives. I'll answer the question before I get asked around new tax law and its impact.
1,"I don't mean to fix up the property, I mean, improving of the quality of tenants. As we move higher towards more luxury tenants, rent should be quite favorable and that has always been our strategy, that has always been the direction for which we've been working on. And I think in some of those properties, you will begin to see in the next year or two positive results in terms of upgrading our shopping centers from, I'll say, a four-star to a five-star or sub five-star."
1,"I don't see our portfolio having something that right now that we would just be compelled to start on a spec basis at this point in the cycle. We really want to   I think it's our very disciplined strategy on development, has delivered just great value for the shareholders and we look to remain disciplined. Having said that, we do see built-to-suit opportunities coming in as we talked in previous calls, and we do have some conversations with existing customers where we see the potential of those needs maybe being able to do something of a similar nature that we've been able to grow with other existing customers."
1,"I don't think it is a question of one particular player. I think there are three issues to be solved in Saffola without we getting into the details, because that is a strategic plan. I think one is obviously the price table for certain competitive offerings from which upgradation happens, because of heavy discounting, that has got impacted."
1,"I guess, a couple of things just to check in on, I mean, first thing just thinking about, we've had our discussions around strategic initiatives and growth for the last probably a year, a-year-and-a-half. Can you guys go forward with the ARBOC acquisition we've talked a little bit about maybe international plays, school buses, different product categories."
1,"I guess, Alton, what I would add is just some color on what we are thinking about in terms of some potential investment for the $10 million to $12 million in tax savings. So we are continuing to look at things that will strengthen our brand, support the strategic initiatives that we've already talked about, and enhancing our employee experience. And so as we look at those, we're evaluating things in the range of benefit plans to ensure that they position us to be an employer of choice for our employees."
1,"I have also worked on the capital markets side of the business helping dozens of companies to raise millions of dollars to help fund their growth. This experience and my background in resources are relevant and come with the new strategic initiative that I'll discuss in a moment. So, let me provide a high level of overview with some of our key establishments in 2017."
1,I have three points I would like to comminute today on our call. With our funding from our rights offering we have commenced our restructuring activities to support our strategic plan. We have completed our first full measurement period for customer success and it's coming in at 27%.
1,"I know that there's a significant portion that's passed through, but there's some that you absorb. Related to this, does that also   if we do see things like tariffs implemented, is that something that would affect your customers' strategy vis-Ã -vis where they're going to be doing stampings or structures? Could they be moving some of those assets?"
1,"I know you want to make sure that the company is taking full advantage of its differentiated position in emerging markets and the scale of the business there and sort of reaching your full potential from a top line perspective. Given some of the service issues in North America and the need to continue to stabilize that business, is this a year where we may continue to see a bit more of the near-term reinvestment flowing back into developed markets than may ultimately be the case once we get through your initial assessment and the multi-year strategic plan that we'll hear about later in the year?"
1,"I mean, I think originally it was   hopefully rebuild the sales channel and then hopefully cross-sell a lot of products into the SMB base. I don't know if that has played out well, or if that's still part of the long-term strategic plan, or if these are really two separate entities that could be better suited to be independent."
1,"I mean, the main impact would be there. There are two investments in the strategic plan that will take place perhaps in the following period. That 10% affects those â‚¬3 billion, so perhaps that'll be a difference of some â‚¬300 million."
1,"I mentioned the two acquisition we made at the beginning of this year and development of affinity groups which is   it is our vision of the future, a key element of the new digital world. We need digital tools, we need reactivity, customer-centric processes et cetera, but we also need reassurance, confidence, communities and our strategy is based on the development of those communities. So, it is a very long-term vision, but we need such a vision as our DNA is a long-term vision DNA."
1,I only have one question actually. You mentioned the 2017 digital achievements and how you're working on your strategy. Can you tell us what's the focus or what are the key projects or initiatives in 2018 that we should be looking at?
1,"I personally think that will be enough, but as you'll probably expect, I think there'll be two different changes that happen. One is where we spend that in the future is likely to be different than the past, both given how the world is changing and some of the strategic priorities I'm laying out. And so, I think there'll be opportunities for us to reallocate some of that money."
1,"I take the loss of any contract or opportunity very seriously. As a result, my teams are taking a fresh look at our strategic plans to lock down renewals and rebids. One way we are doing this is by reexamining the most productive way to frame and communicate to our government partners our tremendous value proposition and the way our model works to make digital government better."
1,I think it is fitting to reflect upon this now as we discuss our second quarter results where we achieved new record revenues and earnings. These results exemplify the strong forward momentum we have in achieving our strategic priorities. Headlining our results was a very strong performance of our 3D sensing business.
1,I think maintaining our focus is going to be critical. We chose these three strategic priorities not because they're the right things to do in 2018. They're the right things to do over the next three to five years.
1,"I think maybe to start with the second question on the Pay TV strategy, I think we are clearly revising our strategy to the extent that we are now much more focused to proactively monetize the assets over a larger audience by also making partnership or doing wholesale arrangements. And we're more going to be operating our premium content business and more alongside some of the more classic models rather than keeping the content exclusively available for our own customers and footprint."
1,"I think one thing that's really been beneficial to us and we've enjoyed is what's happened with Rycan and it certainly showed us the ability to grow maybe a smaller tuck-in type company into our base. So I wouldn't say we're actively looking and have changed our strategy significantly, but we're certainly trying to look and see what's out there. And if we see anything, we want to be in a position to take advantage of it."
1,I think our general strategy is   it's going to be no different this year than in the past years. As we focus   and priority is organic growth because there we have the most effective capital sort of efficiency and return on our money.
1,"I think that there is good business to be done in the region. Part of our strategy in international is to accumulate scale regionally by picking up a series of smaller markets. It's not an easy strategy to implement, but if you look at the Eurasian markets, you look at the Eastern Europe and the GCC, we're not looking at around at this point or going that far."
1,"I think the mood I detect one speaking with investors is that, as Mercer matures and our assets are hitting their stride and demonstrating the reliability and the capability and Mercer is becoming a different company than it was 10 years ago. You also see the narrative around growth and our strategic plan more and more in discussion, investors interested in where we're going and how we think about it and that creates some expectations. And so we typically trade pretty well compared to our peer group now, it's   some of the challenges in the stock, I think relate around the bigger macro picture around pulp, it's got a history of   if you go back there's been periods of excess supply that extended for long periods of time to now a period of, wow, it's the growth on the planet is such that that there's not enough fiber."
1,"I think this slide is important, the 2020 targets; again not aspirational. This is a slide that is based on the aggregation of strategic plans that we have on hand. So, every year, we ask our business units to forecast themselves out for three years, management incentivize on this."
1,"I think we have products that can hit very well and we know that the sales that we already have outside of Europe. But our strategy is to be the long-term active shareholders in all the companies where we have proprietary products, good possibilities for international growth and the long-term perspective. So I think that most of the companies or almost all of the companies in our portfolio at this time are meeting our investment criteria in a very good way."
1,"I think we'll look at obviously what we need to do for the shareholder from a dividend perspective. Certainly, what can we do from our strategic planning process and are there some things that we can accelerate into 2018 that might have been on the drawing board for 2019 or 2020. And so those are the things we're balancing."
1,I think we'll use debt to fund acquisitions to the extent they become available. But I don't really see changing our debt profile as part of our strategy. I think this is a high-quality company that needs to keep the flexibility to pursue whatever strategies make sense in our businesses.
1,"I think we're progressing well on improving business performance, and we've built a good foundation to have an even stronger 2018. We'll be making some minor adjustments to our strategic priorities, but not to our overall strategic plan for achieving growth, increasing our profitability and generating better free cash flow. I look forward to communicating further specifics on these adjustments throughout the coming quarters, but here are my initial points of emphasis I want to share with you."
1,"I think we've been always extremely clear about that. But if you look at the evolution of profitability since 2011, I think that we have shown that we are continuously improving and, of course, we have to continue to do that, using both the unit cost policy, we'll continue to develop and the new environment created by the strategic initiatives we have taken in 2017."
1,"I think you know from our standpoint, Tim, we looked at these   we have a running list of initiatives that we keep   strategic initiatives as part of our broader five-year plan. And I think there is a combination of factors that enter into our decision to do more in 2018."
1,"I think you'd expect to see an improving position within the target range. I think as we get to the bottom of the target range, it brings up capital management, it brings up strategic priorities and there may be other investment opportunities that we'll need to consider at that time. So, I think we're trying to meet the expectations of our shareholders who want DRP."
1,"I think you've heard us today talking about asphalt and transportation cost, because the inflation we're seeing on transportation is not diesel-related, which we tend to handle through a price inflator, but it's actually base-rate related, which is related to the number of trucks that are out there, the number of drivers and what they're getting paid per mile. So we have work to do to make sure that that gets into our thought process and our pricing strategy, and we believe that we've got that issue well in hand. So we believe we've got enough pricing visibility that we should be able to recover asphalt cost inflation and transportation cost."
1,"I think, when we look at the year overall, two main events for us. The acquisition of TerraVia that gives us a very strong algae platform, which I will talk about in a minute; and, of course, the Capital Market Day, where we laid out our new strategy for the years going forward, which really is building on our previous strategy of disciplined value creation, but now with a much stronger focus on creating sustainable growth. So moving to the next page, looking at a quick update on algae ingredients."
1,"I visited all four of our regions, 8 of our 10 biggest markets, and I plan to continue to visit critical markets in the months to come. I've spent that time mainly listening and observing to be able to lead this business with knowledge and to drive that new strategic plan. I've been very impressed by the power of our brands in so many local markets and how committed our colleagues are to winning in the marketplace."
1,"I want to highlight the exceptional increase in Latin America that can be attributed to continued growth in Mexico and Brazil. Once again, this year, the alignment of all our employee around our key strategic priorities of growth, agility, and lean enterprise was instrumental in the achievement of solid result and the delivery of multiple project to help us achieve our long-term objective. More specifically, we introduced two new side-by-side platform, the new Sea-Doo platform and extended the REV Gen4 snowmobile platform to new Ski-Doo and Lynx models."
1,"I want to review our 2017 performance, provide you with our guidance for 2018, provide you with an overview of our trends that we see taking place in our businesses. I want to review a number of key strategic initiatives that are ongoing at ADESA   or excuse me, at KAR, and then finish up with comments on capital allocation. First, let me comment on our 2017 performance."
1,"I want to take a few minutes to give you an overview of 2017 and talk a little bit at a high-level about our expectations for 2018, and then turn presentation over to David. Just start by reiterating that we're focused on a successful execution of strategic initiatives that we laid out now two years ago. We're particularly focused on can we grow and diversify revenue."
1,"I want to thank our team for their ongoing efforts. With their talent, I'm confident we have the people, the strategy and the resources to reach our objectives. And with that, I'll turn the call to the operator to take us into Q&A."
1,"I want you to think about that, that's a significant accomplishment for Sientra. We also made significant progress on each of our strategic initiatives designed to position a new Sientra to re-enter even stronger growth phase than we have just completed. Over the past year, we have grown our addressable market substantially, primarily by diversifying our aesthetic portfolio through the addition of miraDry, and we've accomplished this transformation while maintaining our best-in-class sales force, and most importantly, steadily advancing our submission with the FDA to secure approval for a U."
1,"I was just going to say, the only thing that I would add is that our strategy does remain the same. We are going to be disciplined and opportunistic in terms of what we go after."
1,"I will continue that word and make more steps towards the lining the size of our businesses overall need. I'm excited about these strategic initiatives and the opportunity they will present. Steps have been taken in the right direction and with our renewed focus in some areas, I'm confident we can accelerate the pace of change."
1,I will discuss IXYS in more detail in a few minutes. We continued the strong traction with our strategy by focusing and investing in high growth markets. Our teams have done an outstanding job of executing on our strategy.
1,I will leave you with the following thoughts. We are very pleased to be delivering well against our 2020 strategic plan. The progress we have made is a testament to the dedication of our people to a strategy they understand and drive.
1,"I will provide more detail on the performance of our Food and Animal Safety segments as well as offer some perspective. Those of you who have followed Neogen have often heard Jim detailing Neogen's four-legged growth strategy. First, increase market share; second, develop new and innovative products that our customers need; third, grow internationally and fourth, to grow through acquisitions."
1,"I won't dwell on the leadership issues at CBS Radio, but suffice it to say that it was under-managed by its divisional leadership and lacked strategic focus and energy, playing not to lose rather than to win. We have made important strides at energizing and reinvigorating the organization, elevating expectations, establishing clear strategic priorities and building a collaborative can-do, engaged performance-based organization. We have moved to eliminate silos, enhanced systems, streamline process and more."
1,"I would like to begin with highlights of the previous quarter and year-ended and our CFO, Andy Long will provide an overview of our financial result. I will conclude with an update on our strategic initiatives and key priority and after that we will take your questions. Since I joined INSYS last April, we have established the foundation for the company's transformation by resetting our vision, significantly augmenting our leadership and organizational capability, and taking aggressive actions to change how we run our business."
1,"I would like to note that Q4 2017 brings to close one of the most transformational years for the MaxLinear. During 2017, we started to realize the benefits of our strategic initiatives related to market diversification and target market expansion, which we embarked on a few years ago. In 2017, our infrastructure business grew by more than 90% year-over-year which offset a double-digit decline in connected home owing to a $65 million revenue headwind from legacy Entropic revenues."
1,"I would like to remind everyone that certain statements made during this conference call are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended.

1,"I would now like to discuss our new guidance policy. While we work through this current transition and the KeyBanc strategic planning process, the company will not be issuing earnings guidance. However, in an effort to remain transparent, we will keep you apprised of major business activities as appropriate."
1,"I would particularly like to highlight on this page the total shareholder return which amounted to 31% for the full year 2017 and 21% for the last five years, a development which I'm sure you can appreciate we are very proud of. Now turning to page 15, and we have summarized the highlights of our strategy execution in the past year. Our key priorities for 2017 was to grow and protect value in our large listed companies and to drive sustainable growth in our private assets."
1,"I would say overall, our strategy as a reminder is to grow by adding accounts, going deeper and adding new products. We executed obviously against these in 2017 and drove 30% disposable growth."
1,"I would tell you that I've had discussions with the Compensation Committee about the short-term and long-term plans here at Ford and got their support that the vision that we're painting for fitness, quality improvements, the smart vehicle, smart world can be really supported by the leverage that we have with our share program and a long-term program. We have a performance share program that's tied to shareholder return and in a time-vested stock."
1,"Icade is going very fast and Icade has been even accelerating its performance, as you will see with the 2017 performance results, which will be presented to you by Olivier Wigniolle and Victoire Aubry in a few minutes. These results are very robust and show that Icade's performance is ahead of its strategic plan as was presented to you in November of 2015. That is dating back 2 1/2 years."
1,"I'd like to remind you that as we transform Manulife into a digital customer-centric market leader, we're focused on what matters most. This focus is reflected in our five strategic priorities. One, we're optimizing our portfolio to make sure we're putting our capital to best use; two, we're aggressively managing our cost to be competitive and create value; three, we're accelerating growth in our highest potential businesses; four, we're putting focus on our customers; five, we're building a high-performing team and culture."
1,"I'd like to sign off where I started. We remain committed to delivering our strategy to grow by investing in the structural opportunities in the budget hotel and coffee market, both in the UK and in internationally. We have increased the momentum in executing the strategic plan we set out in November 2016."
1,I'd like to thank our global workforce for all their hard work in making 2017 one of the best years in Limelight's history. I'm very encouraged by our solid momentum on our strategic priorities and I expect this trend to continue. We believe that we are well positioned well-positioned for continued revenue growth and margin expansion as we remain disciplined in our approach to managing cost and pricing across our customer base.
1,I'd like to thank the investors I've had the opportunity to speak with over the past few months as our conversations have helped shape our views on our strategy as we head into 2018. Progress is successfully executing a clear strategic plan to drive sustainable long-term shareholder value. The board and I are excited about our prospects for the future and truly appreciate your continued input and support.
1,"I'd like to thank you for your participation today. I think the company is focused on a strategic plan. We finished the year with good momentum, two strong quarters, and 2018 is looking very strong also."
1,"I'd like to welcome you to our call today. This is the second call in our series to give you more detail on our sectors and our strategy to deliver sustained growth and value creation. As such, we will not be giving a trading update as part of this call."
1,"I'd really rather not get any deeper than that other than to say that, this is an important part, we believe in the very near future, we're going to spending a lot of cash off that we want to put to work for our shareholders. We think this is an important element of our go-forward strategy."
1,"I'd say that our capital deployment strategy, we continue to look at it. We're actually currently updating our capital allocation and cash deployment strategy."
1,"Identifying clear ways in which we can leverage the considerable strength of our business and be more efficient, releasing capacity to better capitalize on opportunities to accelerate our growth. And today, we are announcing a series of strategic initiatives that map across the key elements of our model. These builds on our existing strategy will help us produce even stronger results."
1,"If I had to sum up the fourth quarter in one sentence, it will be pretty much how I would sum up the year and that is that it was a difficult quarter, but we feel that we continue to make good progress as a company. In terms of the agenda today, I'll talk you briefly through the highlights, then Terje, he will come on and talk about the financials and then I will come back with an operational review, update on our strategy and then I'll speak a little bit more than we usually do in terms of prospects and market update towards the end of the presentation. Because we are broadcasting this presentation live, I kindly ask you to wait until the end with questions and after that we'll be available for whatever questions you may have."
1,"If we can get to a good deal and one that adds value for our customers and our companies, we'll do it. If we can't get to the finish line, it doesn't change our strategy. This is a great complement to our strategy but not a must-do."
1,"If you add those figures back, Steven, you get to $186 million of what I'll call normalized free cash flow, which is very close to the 100% of net income commitment that we made at our Investor Day in 2016. So we're generating cash, but at the same time, we're also investing in our strategic priorities and for the future growth of this company."
1,"If you assume, our midpoint of production guidance for 2018, this equates to an estimated growth rate in production year over year of 35%, very impressive. Please turn to the next slide, slide number 13, Achieving Our Objectives and Delivering Value. Now if we look towards the next couple of years to come after 2018, looking forward into 2019 and 2020, you will notice significant growth within the production profile."
1,"If you haven't had a chance, I recommend checking it out to see for yourself how well it aligns with our corporate strategy and simplifies the customer buying experience. As we work to execute on our strategic priorities throughout the year, we also utilized our strong balance sheet and cash flow in a number of ways to enhance shareholder value. We made two key acquisitions."
1,"If you look at the convenience category, probably the largest sales of Gatorade and some of the other equivalent products are in a larger size bottle, not their smaller size. So, we've taken the view that there is a market that for a 25-ounce resealable bottle and we are introducing it in flavors that are different to the flavors in the can because our strategy is to have the two sit side-by-side on a shelf, so that the consumer will have an option of a can or the bottle. And if there is, going forward, supply problems on the can, there will still be bottles on the shelf."
1,"If you recall, we entered 2017 with many key initiatives already in progress at our Regulated Operations and within our Energy Infrastructure and Related Services businesses. Strategic initiatives from both broader business lines reflect ALLETE's commitment to answering our nation's call for cleaner energy farms and water conservation while growing ALLETE. Minnesota Power made significant progress in 2017 with its EnergyForward strategy."
1,"IFRS 9 will impact particularly the coverage ratio any differently to the normal provisioning that we've been doing in 2017 and previously the coverage ratio to improve during 2018. In terms of cost to income ratio, when we set out our five-year strategy, we said we would reduce our cost to income ratio by 2% at least every year in those five years. We're actually ahead of that target, but acknowledge the cost to income ratio continues to be above the rest of the market which averages around 30%."
1,"I'll conclude with some brief comments about the progress on our strategy and outlook for FY 2018. But first on strategy, I'll spend just a couple of minutes giving an update on the good progress we're continuing to make against each of our strategic priorities. These are the same priorities we've listed for the past few results so there should be no surprises in a way we're managing the business and implementing our growth agenda."
1,"I'll cover each of those points now starting with capital allocation. We are going to allocate capital much more selectively in accordance with our new strategy. For those businesses which we categorize as improve, we will target a CapEx-to-depreciation ratio of less than 1."
1,"I'll first review our fleet changes for 2017 and then discuss our current fleet expectations for 2018. We had another busy year executing on our strategy to renegotiate on profitable contracts and transition our fleet to larger new aircraft as well as redeploying aircraft with extended flying terms as pilot hiring exceeded our operating plan. From year-end 2016 to year-end 2017, we move from 652 total aircraft to 595 total aircraft in our fleet."
1,I'll start on slide 3. 2017 was a strong year for Eastman as we made great progress in our strategy to transform towards a specialty portfolio and create attractive value for our shareholders. I'm pleased to report that we met or exceeded the financial targets that we set last January.
1,"I'll then hand over to Peter to talk you through our financial performance in more detail. After that, I will finish up with a focus on our FY 2018 strategic priorities and outlook. If could start on page 4, financial highlights."
1,"I'm also pleased with the progress we have been making with our patent protected dry battery electrode technology, where we have already achieved significant technology milestones that will position us for strategic partnerships, which could accelerate the commercialization of our revolutionary technology. In 2018, we will continue executing on our strategic plan to leverage the business transformation in megatrends to deliver long-term growth and shareholder value. Operator, we are now ready to open the call up for questions."
1,"I'm also pleased with the way our teams pulled together in the quarter to drive savings through our cost mitigation efforts. And as you will hear from Larry shortly, we might further progress to improve productivity in the quarter both from our manpower planning and shuttling strategic initiatives. Consequently, America's adjusted EBITDA increased 6% in the quarter to $107 million driven by revenue growth as well as from the benefits of greater efficiencies and our cost saving measures."
1,"I'm confident that both Dan and Scott's deep operational experience with fast growing medical device companies will be invaluable as we seek to bring the benefits of the MRIdian Linac System patients around the world. And I look forward to working with them to advance our near-term and longer term strategic initiatives. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ajay for some comments on the financials."
1,I'm extremely proud of our team. They have stayed focused and have been able to deliver strong performance while advancing our core strategic initiatives and transitioning Versum to a standalone company. This is truly an exciting time for everyone at Versum.
1,I'm extremely proud of the team's accomplishments in 2017. Their continued execution on strategic initiatives and unwavering focus on our core Environmental Services assets allowed us to strengthen our market position and expand our growth opportunities. This perseverance amidst the many challenges and setbacks while still delivering revenue and EBITDA growth is a true testament to their drive and commitment to deliver unequaled service excellence.
1,"I'm glad to inform you that this initiative is gaining momentum and we are aggressively pursuing this segment and we have seen an improvement in samples for patients as well. As I move to update our strategic initiatives, I'm pleased to share that we received the final regulatory clearances in end December for our Kolkata Reference Lab project and we have started pilot test operations in that lab. Equipment stabilization is in progress and we should see steady ramp-up in the coming months."
1,"I'm going to ask these guys to just mention a little bit about their area of responsibility, but then deal with what is one of my favorite questions, which has to do with focus. During the end of 2017, the strategic initiative that we had underway really was a lot about focus. So I'm going to ask each of them to comment on exactly what are they doing in their respective areas, specifically the top two or three things, and how we're measuring success along the way."
1,"I'm going to provide a brief review of strong results we reported this morning as well as our outlook for continuing profit momentum in 2018 and 2019. I'll spend a few minutes on the solid progress we've made on our three-year strategic plan, including an update on our breakthrough initiatives that were gaining traction on in the U. S."
1,"I'm going to start the call by providing a high level view of our performance for the quarter, then I'll turn the call over to Jim for details on our financial results. Lee will follow with a review of our business segments and strategic initiatives, and I'll conclude with guidance for the first quarter before opening up the lines for questions. I'll focus on operating earnings and my remarks this morning as it's the best reflection of our true performance for the quarter."
1,"I'm going to start today's call with a brief overview of recent activities before turning the call over to Frank to review our financial results as well as our current outlook for the business. After that, I'll provide a more thorough update on our strategic initiatives designed to grow the company. This morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results which were impacted by Hurricane Irma as well as an operational disruption at one of our largest customers this past October."
1,"I'm joined on the call today by Patrick Gibson, GWA's Group CFO. For today's results presentation, I'll first provide an overview of our group results and key themes, Patrick will then provide details of our group financial results, including P&L, balance sheet and cash flow and also segment earnings; I will conclude with a brief summary of the continued momentum we're making in our strategic priorities, I'll touch on the potential sale of D&A following a recently completed strategic review and also provide an outlook for this current financial year, FY 2018. So moving to slide 6."
1,"I'm Jon Ayers, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IDEXX. I'm joined by Brian McKeon, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kerry Bennett, our Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning. So, we're going to webcast this, and so, you have the option of either using the microphone or having me repeat your question in the way that I'd like to answer it."
1,"I'm not going to go through it in further detail, but you can see from the locations that we are building in very, very good locations in undersupplied environment. Another element of our growth strategy is our community living program. That encompasses the continuum of care to our residents in a co-located environment."
1,"I'm not necessarily the guy who will support the plan, so I'm not a candidate for this next CEO job. My main mission is to make sure that we don't waste any time in implementing our strategic plan, which is well-defined and well-understood by our operational people."
1,"I'm pleased to start out fiscal 2018 with a strong first quarter and the significant progress made across our business and operational initiatives. Over the coming quarters, we will continue executing on the components of our strategic plan, investing in substantial school capacity and the service offering expansion to capitalize on demand, providing market leading and academic outcome driven educational services, innovative and improving quality service that we hope would continuously meet, if not exceeds, customer expectations and to maintain our focus on operational efficiency improvements and the cost management disciplines. With a strong conviction and imminent and the differentiated roadmap for K-12 education and a growing diverse executive team, I'm pleased   very, very much looking forward to continuing our strong performance in the remainder of fiscal 2018, and deliver substantial long-term growth and the return to our shareholders."
1,"I'm pleased to start this morning with some highlights of our accomplishments in 2017. Our targeted investments and execution of our strategic priorities generated solid results, and we managed cost across all businesses to improve margins and provide resources for capital investment and future growth. The achievements, which are shown on slides 20 and 21, paves the way for 2017 results."
1,"I'm proud of our company's financial performance in 2017. I'm also excited about the strategic initiatives we have underway that will ensure First American remains an industry leader for years to come. Our core business continues to grow and we are focused on providing innovative solutions for our customers using First American's unique assets including our data, our technology and our bank."
1,"I'm sorry. Without getting into any customer-specific, clearly, part of our strategy has to be that when we take increases you know we work with our customers on those increases."
1,"I'm sure that you have read that also other retailers in Germany and the UK reported similar developments. While last quarter's earnings were certainly a disappointment, I believe it's important to stress that our strategy, our growth drivers remain intact. We believe that our strategy is the right answer to the massive changes in the consumer electronics market."
1,"I'm thrilled to comment this morning what I think is a very solid set of results. And even more importantly for me is closing a year which has been both a year of full delivery of our objectives and commitments, including to you, and in preparation for 2018 as a good year on the roadmap to our 2020 objectives. So, if you turn with me on page 4, this is basically the landscape in which we are working on developing our business."
1,"I'm very pleased with where our people have taken this company. In 2017, the Liberty team delivered increasingly strong results while making significant strides on our strategic plan. I expect 2018 will be another year of strong operational performance and value-enhancing investment activity."
1,"Importantly, as we think about quality of earnings, looking at the two circled orange bars, the net impact of pre-tax income from purchase accounting was approximately $13 million in 2017 and is currently expected to decline only $3 million in 2018. Turning to slide 10, let's take a look at the progress against our long-term financial goals which were approved by the board in the fall of 2014 as part of our strategic planning process. These goals were originally set with a five-year time horizon in mind, yet we achieved these long-term financial goals on a quarterly basis in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the realization of the economic benefits of the FirstMerit acquisition."
1,"Importantly, the acquisitions bring an attractive 2,000-plus customer base, adding diversification and tremendous cross-selling opportunities as customers increasingly migrate to software-based cloud solutions. We also made significant strides improving the health of our balance sheet, providing us with ample financial flexibility and liquidity to execute on our strategic initiatives. In the first quarter of 2017, we successfully sold our remaining stake of CyrusOne."
1,"Importantly, we expect to achieve all five financial goals on a GAAP basis for full year 2018 two years ahead of schedule. We have recently begun our 2018 strategic planning process and we'll be sharing new long-term financial goals for the company later this year. Slide 11 highlights the FirstMerit-related cost savings and strategic revenue synergies."
1,"Importantly, we expect to achieve all five of the restated financial goals on a GAAP basis for full-year 2018, two years ahead of schedule. On slide 10, given the success, we recently began a new three-year strategic planning process. Our past two strategic plans significantly advanced the company's financial performance and competitive positioning."
1,"In 2017, the first full year of our updated strategy, we delivered record sales, earnings, and cash flow. We also made substantial progress in several of our key strategic initiatives. We took a majority ownership position in Monolith Semiconductor and launched our first silicon carbide product."
1,"In 2017, total acquisition volume at the sponsor increased by more than 20% year-over-year. Our strategic initiatives and the reorganization of our internal acquisition teams both contributed to improved performance, and you can see one result of the strong production at our sponsor in the growing number of assets in the ROFO asset portfolio, plus the additional assets under management, which stood at approximately 900 assets as of January 31, 2018. This portfolio has continued to grow notwithstanding the recently completed Fund H transaction in January of this year."
1,"In 2017, we had -from point of view of exploration works, 2017 was a very successful year. Our exploration program that year was in line with our strategy. We remain focused on brownfield activities, because this is an effective way to maximize the value of group production facilities for the longer term, and so we were focusing on high-grade targets."
1,"In 2018, we also continue to focus on three key priorities. First is to maintain KFC sales momentum, continue the revitalization of Pizza Hut, and drive our digital strategy. So that's a quick summary."
1,"In 2018, we expect CapEx to be at around $650 million. Our four strategic priorities has seen a slight change in view of positive market development and our strong performance in 2017. We will continue to work on deleveraging and we will remain   we will maintain regular dividend payments to our shareholders."
1,"In 2018, we expect to increase our investment in R&D to deliver new product, feature and functionality building on past success. New product introduction and our focus on customer with 1,000 or more employees sure our land and expand strategy which is paying off. This mid and large size enterprises know that they have a problem and we see less friction in the sales motion when we reach leaders in these companies who control the budget."
1,"In 2018, we will conclude the divestment of our non-core assets, fully execute the DG Com restructuring plan, and intensify our balance sheet de-risking efforts through organic and inorganic reduction of our NPL book.

Hain Celestial remains uniquely positioned in the growing organic, natural and Better-For-You products industry."
1,"iPic is a one-of-a-kind four-hour, out-of-home enterprise experience that's an affordable luxury, with pioneer designing and movie experience and we lead the industry in innovation. We see tremendous white space opportunity ahead of iPic, both domestically and internationally, and believe we have the key strategic initiative in place to deliver long-term profitable growth and increase value to our stockholders. With that, operator, please open the lines for questions."
1,"is still performing really well for us. We continue to attract and retain good people, which is core to what we do and want to continue to invest and we have the data and analytics strategic initiative. So I think 2018, we start the year with a lot of optimism."
1,"It allows us to push our pipeline and discovery forward. This brings us to our strategic priorities and what we would like to accomplish in the next five years. In the next five years, we want to bring at least three products to the market."
1,"It also means being preferred with our customers, preferred with our growers, preferred partners in innovation, and perhaps most importantly preferred with our employees. As you can see on the next slide, we believe we can become the global leader by executing on three strategic priorities   accelerating category and customer growth, differentiating our global supply chain to drive growth, and investing for growth. The three strategies are what we have been executing over the past year."
1,"It also was an area where, because of our distribution strategy, the sheer magnitude of the dollars invested against awareness, were significantly less than in the United States. So the acquisition of Robopolis and our continued global focus on IP capture and generation certainly is part of our strategy to improve our competitiveness in EMEA. And we think it's always been a great market for us and these actions that we took last year with Robo and the actions that   from an IP strategy initiated many years ago but there's a long lead time on that, is leading to increasing numbers of patents being issued in Europe, is all meant to shore up our European strategy."
1,"It doesn't mean we don't have some great competitors, it doesn't mean we're going to win every deal that's out there, but we feel really good about our position. And as Dan tried to describe, our strategy is an evolution and an investment protection strategy for our customers. Not only can you do what you need to do today to add capacity and have a lot of runway with the product, but it supports upgrades that are enabling this distributed access architecture."
1,"It doesn't represent a change in strategy. Our strategy has always been to have our broad relationship with Biogen which continues to be tremendously productive, but identify drugs that are appropriate for us to develop ourselves. And so it just represents the success of that strategy."
1,"It is important that we continue to expand in the markets we serve today as well as develop new markets. We expect to add additional resources in 2018 to meet our objectives to grow this business by strong double digits again in 2018. Regarding mineral processing, we expect to develop additional opportunities for our underutilized manufacturing plants during 2018."
1,"It is intended that these will be reinvested in product development, marketing and technology to support further growth. Technology is a key enabler of our business, and the majority of our capital expenditure is now directed towards technology investments, primarily in our Online business but also to support our omni-channel strategy and prepare for the opening of the U. S."
1,"It is still a little early due to competitive reasons for us to share our 2019 orders, but we'll provide updates as the year progresses. So little on the financial overview, the fourth quarter continued the improving financial performance we experienced throughout the year driven by strong metrics as we continued to execute on our core business strategy of providing contract compression services focused on large horsepower compression. With a good portion of 2017's total horsepower deliveries installed, both adjusted EBITDA and DCF increased to $42."
1,"It is too early to tell what, if any, impact this could have on our manufacturing footprint, as we transition through this change. With this in mind, we would like to reiterate that our Performance Materials segment remains a critical component of our long-term strategy and we remain committed to supporting our Performance Materials customers to drive profitable growth in their business as demonstrated by our new product, carpet and specialty paper products. In summary, we see 2018 as an acceleration toward the new OMNOVA that I've been talking about since I became CEO last year, a company with a true specialty solutions portfolio."
1,It really is not a factor in our pricing models or in our indirect rate structures that are part of our bid strategies. So the cash component really shows up in reinforcing our capital deployment strategy as opposed to affected by price or approach within a customer or competitive landscape.
1,"It seems like you're broadening some of the site level initiatives not only to the underperforming or lower performing locations, but also some of the higher performing operations. So can you share a little bit more about, one, why that's the case, and then number two, what the response has been from the physicians themselves or practitioners regarding these strategic initiatives?"
1,"It strengthens the overall quality of our portfolio as we further refine our demographic and geographic mix, and then provides the growth capital to support our development and redevelopment programs. We'll provide more details on our objectives for 2018. Fourth, maintain our strong leasing momentum and increase same-site NOI."
1,"It takes the team to execute the kind of operational performance we seek. With Bob's approaching retirement, we've brought on a new business partner in the CFO role that Stephen   I think Stephen Nolan will help us advance our objectives. Stephen brings a wealth of financial and business acumen with over 15 years of high level business management experience, including complex public company management."
1,"It was our first full year as a standalone company. We've made a significant amount of progress on our strategic priorities, and we're in a stronger position today than when we launched just over a year ago. We recognize that there are still lots of work to be done, and we look forward to 2018 and beyond."
1,"It will be in the results we're quite sure of that. We are successfully executing on our strategic plan for 2015 to 2017 and now are embarking on our 2018 to 2020 strategic plan which we'll discuss in greater detail later. This team is committed to determining our thinking, our strategy in advance and has a phenomenal track record on execution."
1,"It's a great model for us to continue growing and we've had really strong performance through Japan, Korea and others. If anyone's been through LAX, we like our strategy here working with HMSHost and other partners right now to build in airports. This is an extraordinarily busy restaurant, go see it next time you're in Terminal 3 in LA."
1,"It's a great question because again people can convince themselves of anything. So, I think we believe that this is not a departure from our strategy around simplification because, frankly, we still have a lot of work to do on that front. So, these acquisitions are, in the case of the Global Cash Card, we did have a card business, but we have a very clear plan that is fairly quick around migrating onto the Global Cash Card platform."
1,"It's a great story and we plan to continue to allocate significant capital to this business in the future. Moving to our strategic priorities, first and foremost, the integration of the company and capturing synergies. On the synergy front, well, we're three weeks in and the integration is going very well, and we are aggressively moving towards the capture of the $500 million of synergies."
1,"It's a key digital platform that allows a vendor to manage their sales, invoicing, marketing, and servicing, all from one comprehensive system. Before I turn it to John, I want to touch on our strategic plan. We mentioned during our earnings call, we have updated our ROTCE target to 11% to 12% over the next two to three years, which is what we are defining as medium term."
1,"It's also important to note that the better-than-expected stability of the ACA enrollment in 2018 could result in health plans reentering these markets, which could be a positive factor for Inovalon. In conclusion, 2017 was a good year for Inovalon, a year in which we executed well against our strategic plan, achieved our financial guidance, advanced our technology and capabilities to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace, and continued to make progress transitioning our business to a subscription-based cloud-based platform model. We look forward to continuing our strong business and financial progression in 2018 and beyond."
1,"It's also worth noting that we saw a decrease in hospital-acquired conditions and hospital-acquired infections. Second, we executed on a number of strategic initiatives across multiple fronts that have strengthened the foundation of our company for improved growth. I'll mention just a couple of these and Tim will provide additional detail on those later in the call."
1,"It's been an especially busy period since our last call from both an operational and financial standpoint. While wrapping up 2017 is important, our top priorities are the execution of our forward strategy, maintaining financial discipline and operational optimization. During last earnings call, we gave a preliminary outlook for 2018 and now with our board approved budget, we can provide more details around this year's plan and give formal guidance."
1,"It's been really encouraging to see that. So our strategy continues to be drive synergy between the core and classified, expand in a number of markets where they're still up for grabs, acquire and grow where we can sensibly and grow that portfolio of assets. We're in 12 or 13 markets."
1,"It's got two core components and both are starting to use a euphemism, pay dividends. And we think there's a lot of opportunity on both aspects of our strategy. So, we think there's a lot of promising signs and we're hopeful in terms of where it's going to take us over the course of not only this fiscal, but following fiscal years."
1,"It's important to point out that although licensed products typically have a lower gross margin percentage than their historical overall average, it's our expectations products will obviously still add to our top and bottom lines. The last adjustment to our strategic plan that I'll mention today is increasing our priorities and efforts to achieve operating efficiencies. The company has experienced tremendous growth in recent years and, as a result, there are several areas where we see opportunities to further improve efficiencies, increase the output of our plants to support recently and soon to be approved products."
1,"It's in the multiple hundred of million dollars and growing. An added benefit of the joint venture for Cree is it assists us in the first part of our strategy, the pivot to more differentiated applications, because this gives us an opportunity to continue to serve our lighting customers across the whole portfolio of all of their applications for lighting by giving them the differentiated products through our core business and the mid-power products through our joint venture. Now, looking at the two parts of the strategy together, what's the result in our operating margin expansion?"
1,"It's kind of interesting. One, core growth; two, margin performance; three, capital deployment; and four, execution strategy. All right."
1,"It's not really   I don't expect anything in the very short-term from that. However, as we go forward in time and as I mentioned, one of the key strategic priorities for us in future quarter, to really enhance the network effects from the platform, is to get more software on more devices. And so, for us to do that and especially in many Asian countries where we want to go to people   go where people already have strong relationships with OEMs, obviously, Qualcomm is one of those companies and can help us from a channel perspective to accelerate our efforts from a business development perspective."
1,"It's obviously not a quarterly or annual guidance change. So we're going to do this in conjunction with our strategic plans. And we have been growing at rates that are higher than our long-term guidance, and there've been several factors for that."
1,"It's our plan on a page and we've deliberately stayed consistent on how we've talked about our strategy over the last five years. As we look to 2020, we again set ourselves some ambitious targets centered on our strategic priorities. Before I hand over to Ewen to take you through the numbers in a bit more detail, I'd like to leave you with just some key takeaways."
1,"It's ready to both backfill as well as having managers being ready to relocate. And I think we did a good job last year of changing our strategy in how we develop and enter a new market that way. It was successful, and I would see us continuing that strategy throughout this year."
1,"It's the commitment that we made to the organization, and so we are always looking at what we can do to be able to do that. Now, if you look at our late-stage pipeline, we clearly have confidence that we can do that, but we are constantly looking at what is out there that fits our strategy, both within the franchises that we operate in as well as we have a program internally we call New Horizons, where we look at other verticals that might fit with what we're good at. I would say our primary focus is looking for opportunities that can drive strong growth in that 2023, 2024, 2025 timeframe."
1,"It's typically the stores that we're closing are obviously much lower volume. But when we look at the remodels, we're not going to put in a lot of capital into the stores that we think that is not worthy of those sorts of investments that it's not going to be in the long-term plan."
1,"It's very highly competitive, but we are going to be trying to put a lot of effort in that area to try and grow our presence. And you also hit one of other   our other strategic initiatives is, we do want to try and get into long haul, transport, pipelines whether it be crude or natural gas or NGLs. It's an area of focus."
1,"It's worth noting the investment we make on contracts in Q4, you tend to see the benefit of that a year plus. So we're really making sure we're building an infrastructure not just for the immediate, but also long-term plan as well. We will continue our head count investment in contracts, which is a more resilient market."
1,"I've assumed the role of CEO for an interim period. I'm fortunate to have held both the roles of CEO and Executive Chairman over my 17 years here at Equinix, and I've had the privilege of working alongside our leadership team playing an active role in their efforts, our strategy and every major decision the company has made in this timeframe. As we look forward it's our opportunity to accelerate digital transformation and our position as the underlying platform and stewards of our customers' digital infrastructure that has me so excited about our future."
1,"I've got a few slides today that I'll just walk you through, and I'll talk a little bit about who we are, the strategy of the company. I'll work through a little bit of the operating footprint just to give you the size and scale of the company and then talk about 2018 strategic priorities. And then we'll get right into questions."
1,"I've hired a sourcing and procurement expert that I personally worked with in the past who will report directly to me to put a laser-like focus on margin improvement. Although we've just begun, we have identified several opportunities and the teams are putting achievable plans in place to help us obtain our objectives. We will share more detail on this very important initiative in the future."
1,"Jay Benet did say in his opening remarks or maybe it was Brian that looking at the full year was probably a better perspective on the outlook. And I will add, just following up on our comments at our recent Investor Day, that productivity and efficiency are important strategic initiatives for us. We've seen the benefit of that this year."
1,"Joe joined Mattel last October and has already made a positive impact on our company. He brings deep expertise helping companies navigate through transformations and achieve their strategic plan. We are very happy, most of all me, that he is part of our team."
1,"Joel Manby joined the company three years ago. He led the company through major strategic initiatives over the past three years. Now, with our improving operating and financial performance trends, along with the substantial progress he made in enhancing the strategic positioning of the company's brand, the board and Joel together decided this is a good time for this transition and a good time to identify a new CEO who can continue our strategic momentum and intensify our focus on execution."
1,"Johann Pretorius, Renaissance Capital. Could you perhaps share with us a few more thoughts on your longer term growth strategy, which could involve acquisitions for example? Would you be looking at acquiring other iron ore producers or could it be other minerals as well and how does that have to fit in with Kumba strategy?"
1,"John Agwunobi will be promoted to Co-President and Chief Health and Nutrition Officer, focusing on education and training content as well as corporate sales, marketing and events. And John DeSimone will be promoted to Co-President and Chief Strategic Officer, retaining responsibility for strategic planning and investor relations, while assuming reporting responsibilities for the regional managing directors. His keen focus will be overseeing growth strategies and investments and driving performance across all of our regions."
1,"John will begin today's call with review of the financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017. Then Linda will discuss the completion of our three-year strategic plan, the business environment, status of our expansion project in Shelby, North Carolina, our efforts to reduce corporate SG&A expenses, the recently announced reorganization in Lewiston's consumer product division, and our outlook for the first quarter of 2018. And then open up the call for the question-and-answer session."
1,"John, why don't maybe you start out by just talking about some of the strategic priorities and key areas of focus for management over the next year."
1,"Joining me today is Kristina Cerniglia, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, I'll begin by discussing some highlights of the quarter and then I'll review progress on our strategic priorities before turning the call over to Kristina for additional details on our results and guidance. After that, we'll open up the call for Q&A."
1,"Just like the cash return on invested capital goal, we have added a strategic goal related to ROCE on our 2018 incentive compensation plan. That goal is to implement a long-term plan that returns the company to sustainable double digit ROCE. Everybody has a preferred methodology for calculating ROCE with the most significant differences arising from the use of pre- versus post-tax income in the numerator and gross versus net debt in the denominator."
1,"Just maybe starting on the overall strategic plan. It sounds like you've made some pretty decent guidance or a pretty decent flow-through in terms of cost savings on the original $115 million or $145 million, but it sounds like you're in a different cost paradigm now."
1,Just regarding your overall strategy. I know you highlighted 7% to 9% CER growth?
1,"Keith and I were just last week at a strategic business review where each of the brands brought their leadership teams to offsite location. We all got together, had all three brands listen in while they rotated presenting their strategic plans for the long term. You could imagine   you guys would love to sit on that if you're in the restaurant industry and listen in to the conversations from people with 20, 30 years of experience turning brands around in different markets, sharing ideas; one brand saying, yeah, we need to do that, I'm going to follow up with new on that."
1,"Kourous Rezaei, Chief Medical Officer; Dave Carroll, Chief Financial Officer; Keith Westby, Chief Operating Officer; and Vishal Kapoor, Vice President of Business Development. I would also like to remind you that today we will be making statements relating to Ophthotech's future expectations regarding operational, financial and research and development matters, including statements regarding the implementation of our strategic plan, our projected use of cash and cash balances, the timing, progress and result of clinical trials and other research and development activities, the potential utility for our product candidates, and the potential for our business development strategy, including any potential in-license or acquisition opportunities. These statements constitute forward-looking statements for purpose of the Safe Harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995."
1,"Last year, we announced our performance targets for 2020. In 2017, we made progress towards these goals by executing on the four pillars of our growth strategy; market driven, innovation leadership, synergistic M&A, and operational excellence. We believe our ongoing commitment to this blueprint for success will enable us to meet our targets and continue to propel Rogers to a new level of value creation."
1,"Lastly, before turning the call over to Jill, the new tax legislation provides financial benefit to us this year and in coming years. We are evaluating our options, but we plan to reinvest a portion of the benefit in our business and we're looking forward to using a portion of these savings to strengthen our brand, support our strategic initiatives, invest in the employee experience and to drive shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jill."
1,"Lastly, I'd like to thank our investors for their confidence in us as we've executed our Double-Double strategy over the past 10 years. And I hope that you share our enthusiasm about American Tower's potential for strong cash flow growth, and expanded returns over our next 10-year strategic planning cycle. So, with that, I'll turn it over to Tom."
1,"Lastly, with regards to the Tax Act, like all retailers, we are pleased with the recent actions around tax reform. We currently expect to reinvest a good portion of our tax saving in our business specifically around strategic priorities, which may include marketing, technology, and our employees. We will provide more information when we release our Q4 results in May."
1,"Leading into 2017, we had prepared for an acquisition that was strategically designed to fuel continued growth in revenue and in margin, while also enhancing our overall platform, which we are now calling the Inuvo Exchange. This acquisition significantly enhanced both our demand side and machine learning technologies, important components in our strategy to own the end-to-end technology foundation necessary to disintermediate smaller niche players and compete with the bigger players. The rationale for this strategy has been based on the maturing nature of our market, where clients are now looking to reduce the number of suppliers they work with and opting for those suppliers with the broadest and best performing product suites."
1,"Let me begin by saying we're pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results. We successfully met our profitability targets for the year as we continue to diligently execute our strategic plan. For the full year, we reported solid earnings of $1."
1,"Let me start then with the highlights and we'll follow our typical practice of Mark and Pat can walk you through the components of the presentation. For some time, our strategic priorities have centered on improving our returns and our strategic pillars of building our team, growing and diversifying our revenues, while also investing in our business while we keep an ever watchful eye on management of risk. In 2017, we made substantial progress on all of those fronts."
1,"Let me take a moment to discuss our recently announced strategic activity and organic projects to support our growth targets. In the Permian, we have made significant progress in executing our growth strategy. In addition to our refining logistics asset dropdown in 2018, Andeavor expects to offer the newly acquired Rangeland crude oil pipeline and crude oil terminal assets, as well as the remaining Andeavor Permian logistics assets including the Bobcat Pipeline, Wink Terminal and Mason Terminal to Andeavor Logistics."
1,"Let's look at 2017 in more detail. We have delivered on each of the pillars of the strategic plan announced last March, carrying out â‚¬1 billion of CapEx and further consolidating our Italian assets through the acquisition of Infrastrutture Trasporto Gas, and a stake in Italy's largest regas plant. Reverse flow has started, with first bookings on both Tarvisio and Passo Gries."
1,"Let's move to slide number 8. And you've seen this slide before, but we continue to focus on four key strategic priorities for our business. The first is to continue to invest for growth in China, a market that we understand and where we have a record of leadership."
1,"Let's turn now to slide 9. When we presented our 2020 strategy in August 2015, we clearly stated that acquisitions will be an important part of our five-year growth path. Since 2014, we have acquired businesses for a total of CHF 691 million."
1,"Like Carrie, I'm very pleased with our results. We have made significant progress in our product to marketing efforts, as well as our strategic initiatives to simplify the business and generate cost savings. As we look forward, we're focused on sustainable profitable revenue growth."
1,"Likewise, our financials division has performed well with strengthening of both its B2B and B2C offerings of which you will hear more during the presentation. Our balance sheet remains strong allowing us to consider significant strategic initiatives. In line with our confidence and reflecting our strong cash generative model, we are declaring a 10% increase in our full-year dividend."
1,Listen on your strategic priorities that you listed out. You really are focusing on the Outback brand and of course some of the accelerants on that.
1,"Liz, on your strategic priorities that you listed out, you really are focusing on the Outback brand and of course some of the accelerants on that. You didn't talk about the secondary brands that you own."
1,"Look, I can't speculate on how they built up their offer price. I wasn't   I'm sitting on the other side of the negotiating table, so   look, what we did was we presented our strategic plan moving forward. They've got all the data as to current performance and past performance and they would have modeled it out and come up with a number."
1,"Look, I think at the end of the day, when we have these CEO conversations, we have an obligation to drive their success, and their success is completely tied to that   the pace of the digital transformation. And one of the things that I think this company does very, very well and it does drive a big part of our acquisition strategy is, it listens to the customer, and that customer feedback is really, really important. So, we pride ourselves in listening, when they have a business problem or we can anticipate a business problem, we have a solution to that problem."
1,"Look, I think the conservative underpinnings of this company are the foundation of our execution. We're focused on executing our operating strategy, our stated leverage target of 5 times to 6 time remains. But as I said earlier, we're going to be opportunistic in terms of sources of capital."
1,"Look, we're going to stay very focused on serving the customer, leaning into the six strategic plans that I laid out and we believe that puts us in a great position to take advantage of any environment."
1,"Looking ahead to 2018, we expect another year of good organic growth, margin improvement and EPS growth. We remain focused on delivering against our strategic priorities. So, I want to just give you a quick update, and then I'll talk a little bit more about that later."
1,"Looking ahead, we expect another year of earnings growth in constant currency terms, and longer term, the ability of Amcor to generate growth is unchanged. In the medium-term, further progress against our strategic priorities will underpin more than $100 million of PBIT growth across the three-year period ending with fiscal year 2020, in addition to organic growth and further M&A. Over the longer term, the growth potential of the business remains substantial and I'll talk more about this later."
1,"Looking ahead, we see Africa continuing to transform and grow, creating opportunities for us to partner our clients on their growth journeys. We will remain focused on executing on our CIB strategy. That means, continuing to deliver value for our clients, shareholders, employees and communities in markets that we operate in."
1,"Looking at gross margin, beer gross margin expanded a robust 320 basis points crossing the previously elusive milestone of 35% and weaving the strategic with the operational, bear in mind that beer gross margin expansion occurred while winding down contract volumes from past exiting the Wynwood Brewery, ceasing production in Memphis, transferring 150,000 barrels of production to Fort Collins and stabilizing the supply chain. On the spend side, while we continued to invest behind our brands, we were successful in trimming our G&A cost base and better managing our overall spend levels and looking beyond the P&L while we funded key strategic initiatives such as Redhook Brewlab and the new Kona brewery in Hawaii, our debt levels and balance sheet are the healthiest they've ever been. And so, without further delay on to the team for some color on that transformational 2017 and for some detail on those strategic and operational advances, beginning with Ken."
1,"Looking at our opportunity in China, in particular, we continue to see enormous demand in that market. Over the past year, we have been learning more about the marketplace and finalizing our strategy. In many ways, it's a market we already serve well through existing wholesale channels."
1,"Looking at the positive price we've seen combined with the positive material cost productivity we've driven, which is a component of our productivity bridge, we had a positive spread versus material inflation of 70 basis points in 2017, and we'd expect similar performance in 2018. Additionally, we will see a reduction in headwinds from our China strategy as I detailed earlier. And lastly, as discussed at our Analyst Day, we see good opportunity to deliver significantly higher levels of profitability in our large engineered order compressor technology and increasing demand for our higher-margin tools, fluid management and material handling products along with continued mix shift from golf to consumer small electric vehicles."
1,"Looking forward and we look at that different   we're going to consider all options to return cash to shareholders as we go forward. I mean in addition, we'll look at clearly   we'll always look at opportunities out there that are closely married to our strategy. There are a number of companies out there that are   there's probably more higher quality assets potentially available than there have been before that are very close to our strategy."
1,"Looking forward to 2018, I am optimistic about the growth opportunities that lie ahead. We will continue to execute against our four strategic priorities to strengthen our platform and drive profitable growth across our brands. A couple of key initiatives for 2018 include the launch of buy online, pickup in store in Pottery Barn and West Elm following the successful pilot in the Williams-Sonoma brand last November and the recent rollout in Pottery Barn Kids."
1,"Looking forward, we expect the underlying business to continue to perform well. I'm delighted with the headway we've made against our strategic initiatives and the momentum that they bring into the coming year. I'm equally pleased with the progress our teams have made in offsetting the exceptional external headwinds we are facing."
1,"Looking forward, we feel increasingly positive about the economy and our prospects in 2018, and I will as usual discuss our first quarter revenue outlook later on this call. I'll also give you some additional commentary on our trends and an update on our strategic initiatives. Don will give you now a more detailed review of our quarterly results and our 2018 guidance on AFFO and its components."
1,"Looking out over the next five years, we have significant growth opportunities across all of these and we expect continued strong performance from these high-growth initiatives also in 2018. Together with a cadence of new product and solution launches, M&A investments and more regulatory approvals, these are key elements of our portfolio transformation strategy towards faster-growing markets where we believe we can also achieve sustainably higher margins. On slide 9, I show Bruker's key priorities for 2018."
1,"mainland location at Short Hills. The best example of our unique chef-driven dining strategy is at Beverly Center, which is in Phase III of its complete re-imagination. A number of new restaurants have already opened as part of the project and more will be opening throughout 2018."
1,"margins more than tripled in 2017, reaching 3. 4% in the first year of our strategic plan period, including strong sequential and year-over-year improvement in our fourth quarter. We expect 2018 U."
1,"markets where the Northeast region continues to be a key to MAPFRE. As we announced during our last Investor Day, we have already implemented a new strategic plan for this country and expect to see a result soon. As far as I know, we are closer to exit from the states where we have always decided."
1,"Marla and Bill are potent additions to our board and to the Care. com team, particularly in the context of our strategic initiatives that lie at the heart of our core consumer business and growing enterprise business. In summary, we are pleased with our 2017 results as we continue to focus on initiatives that we expect to drive long-term profitable growth."
1,"Maybe one more before I run out of time just. This could potentially inform your registrational path forward and your strategy there, but can you maybe comment on how you're thinking about   you and your team think about additional biomarkers in addition to BRCA status or PD-1, potentially figuring in your strategy here as you move forward potentially."
1,"Maybe turning to the transborder network here, a key part of your growth strategy, driving the sixth freedom traffic, we saw at WestJet's Investor Day they signed a joint venture with Delta. Thoughts on how you think that competitively impacts your transborder strategy and then specifically your partnership with United? They've had some issues over the past 12 months to 18 months."
1,"Maybe, Jonathan, it would be   given your recent promotion, maybe you can just talk a little bit about what your strategic priorities are and maybe how they might be nuanced or different than what the prior strategies are, and then we have a bunch of follow-up topics."
1,"Michael, just to give you some perspective about how we got there, back to the six strategic planks, knowing the customer change, how we engage, expand our fulfillment options, deliver compelling product experiences, growing the Pro, and differentiating the services, that's how we galvanize the organization about where to invest that CapEx and OpEx. We're taking a look at every investment through two lenses."
1,"Minor promotional benefits can happen from time to time, but I will not say that we're giving any large scale or large volume or large discount per se. So our strategy is primarily to focus on Tier-2 cities whereby we can have small to medium dealers and distributors and cater to their needs. See the advantage we have is that we have depots in around 15 centers, 20 centers and these depots can cater to inside the hinterland."
1,"Mint has played a pivotal part in achieving superior margins in our Transcon markets. In the past year, we added 15 Mint A321 aircraft to support our strategy. Existing Mint routes outperformed and new routes were in line with expectations during the fourth quarter."
1,"More importantly, we expect to continue to generate positive cash flow for the foreseeable future. Our capital management strategy remains focused on cash flows, return on invested capital and positioning the company for long-term value. One of the questions I get asked very frequently and it's what is our approach to capital allocation."
1,"More than ever, we are aggressively reviewing our cost structure as we look to strengthen our competitive advantages to better serve our customers. We are committed to ensuring our spending is directed to our highest strategic priorities all on a sustainable basis. Net income is forecasted in the range of $490 million to $515 million or $3."
1,"Moreover, we also going to pay dividends related to the previous years amounting to approximately BRL 70 million, which is also going to be paid in April. Finally, we have a summarized on page 78, summary of strategic priorities for the company for each brand. I'll just highlight the key initiatives here."
1,"Most market estimates for market growth in 2018 range from flat to slightly up, but as our track record has shown, we have the team, expertise, and client base to grow meaningfully faster than the market. We have a strong defendable market position when it comes to multi-family finance, but our mission remains to become the premier commercial real estate finance firm in the United States, and has been the driving force behind our strategy of building out our loan origination platform across the country to grow our client base and access deal flow. We've continuously set ambitious objectives and achieve them, all while remaining disciplined in our growth and true to our stated mission."
1,"Most of that is from the legacy Moody's Analytics business, with some additional contribution from Bureau van Dijk. So we're seeing good success as we continue to rigorously pursue our strategy to drive margin expansion in MA. You may note that we had no head count growth in Moody's Analytics next year."
1,"Most significantly, our base SG&A expenses, which exclude incentive compensation and other benefits, leveraged on a rate basis by approximately 100 basis points. This base expense rate leverage was due primarily to favorable payroll and related cost of approximately 110 basis points, driven by lower benefits cost incurred, the leveraging of our fixed expenses on higher revenues and the savings from our ongoing strategic initiatives, as well as lower expenses of approximately 10 basis points incurred in connection with the construction of new stores and the remodeling of existing stores, partially offset by higher marketing expenses of approximately 30 basis points related to the growth in our online operations. Net incentive compensation cost and other benefits cost aggregated $8."
1,"Moving on then to the transformation section. Clifford mentioned earlier under our strategy that we have implemented this process and we've targeted $100 million by 2021. We have setup the breakdown of the target, you'll see that on the left hand pie chart there of the different elements that will contribute to the $100 million."
1,"Moving on to slide 8. On this slide, we've recapitulated as a reminder some of the strategic initiatives that we undertook in 2017 to expand ALD's footprint. Now, let me hand over to Gilles Momper, ALD's CFO, who will comment on our detailed 2017 financial results."
1,"Moving to slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position as well as continued execution of the capital plan we announced in May. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business."
1,"Moving to the segment overviews, we'll begin with the Consumer segment on slide 14, where we continue to deliver healthy overall business and revenue momentum. One of our primary strategic priorities at SunTrust has been to improve our balance sheet diversity and enhance returns. As a result, we've invested consistently in LightStream and our credit card business."
1,"Mr. Fujii, our President, Global Healthcare will explain the detail about our strategy, everything about precision medicine. Thank you."
1,"My comments this morning will focus on our performance in 2017, and Jolene will take you through the fourth quarter financial results. The year was primarily focused on building additional shareholder value by executing on our growth and diversification strategy in improving our cost competitiveness. We did this by leveraging the synergies and expertise inherent in our three lines of business, being regional aircraft leasing, contract flying, and maintenance, repair and overhaul."
1,"My name is Fernando dela Fuente (sic) [Fernando Lafuente] from Alantra. I just have a question, a follow-up on your investments plan in your strategic plan."
1,"Needless to say, I firmly believe that the strategic direction and actions Adam just discussed are the right changes for the business. Before I begin with the quarterly financial review, I'd like to discuss the financial impacts of our strategic plan and how those changes impact the financial metrics we disclose. To best follow along, please note that we have included a document on our Investor Relations website called supplemental financial deck that we'll refer to throughout this discussion."
1,"Neither simplification changes the overall objectives; they're just a simpler way in how we describe them and an easier way in how to think of them. Overall, our objectives remain consistent, and we hope these additional insights give you a better understanding of how we run our business. In summary, our capital management strategy continues to serve the owners well."
1,"New Kay Ring Try-On App, the launch of 24/7 live chats for diamond consultation in our Jared designer ring platform. In summary, while we were not pleased with our overall holiday performance, we have begun to see positive results from our strategic initiatives as evidenced by the performance of our eCommerce platforms and the Zale division this Holiday Season. This was offset primarily by the negative impact of the credit transition, which was reflected in our revised guidance we communicated in November."
1,"Next year, I'm not sure it's going to be next year, as we continue to clearly invest into that business and the level of profitability of pure consumer business is significantly below what you should expect from more of a prescription of more Specialty Care business. So clearly, our strategy is to transition that business. Today, it's still a business where there is a significant part of the business which is still prescription and benefiting of higher profitability."
1,"Next, I'm excited to share with you some proof points that show that our strategy is working on slide 12. As I discussed a few moments ago, we're implementing our commercial strategy to deploy our Next-Gen Network, expand our retail and digital distribution and leverage target local marketing. We have accelerated this blueprint across a few markets, such as Chicago, Cincinnati and Orlando and we're seeing some very encouraging early success."
1,"Next, investments in our new California distribution center are expected to be approximately $60 million in fiscal 2018. And finally, investments in other strategic initiatives will represent approximately $40 million to $45 million of CapEx in 2018. Depreciation expense for fiscal 2018 is forecasted at approximately $120 million against $117 million in 2017."
1,"Next, we believe the pricing environments for certain portions of the lighting market will continue to be challenging, particularly for more basic, lesser-featured products sold through certain channels. Additionally, while our gross profit margin is influenced by several factors including sales volume, innovation, components and commodity costs, market-level pricing and changes in the mix of products and sales channels, we expect our annual gross profit margin to improve over time as volumes grow, our mix evolves as we execute our tiered solutions strategy and as we realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies. So to be very clear, our focus is to garner additional top-line growth, driven primarily by our ability to outperform the growth rates of the markets we serve, continue to improve the mix of products and solutions as we execute our tiered solutions strategy and to leverage our fixed cost infrastructure to achieve targeted incremental margins to improve our overall profitability."
1,"No I, I think the strategic review we went through all of our businesses at the time we made the decision on the auto business. And so we're confirming our strategy on the other businesses. My only comment on portfolio acquisitions is they have to be consistent with the businesses we're in and so not, not looking for a new asset class to enter through acquisition basis."
1,"No, it's a good question. And we run a annual strategic plan cycle here at NCR. Certainly, with the success we've had, Dan, in the Services transformation, which is also a part of this restructuring and you saw that show through in really the great margin improvements in 2017 that will also continue in 2018 and beyond."
1,"No, we look at it product line by product line and by market and we have manufacturing capacity on both sides of the border for our farm and commercial product lines from a portable perspective and storage perspective and commercial space. So it's been part of our diversification strategy over the last decade."
1,"No, we've just been more aggressive there because we feel that there's more business and products that are being sold at prices or margins that we view as being less attractive than our objectives from a global perspective. So we're being a little bit more aggressive to manage perhaps out some of the less attractive business that we have in our international portfolio."
1,None of this happens without their commitment and execution and I am very proud of what we've achieved together. Now let me shift gears to spend a few minutes on the progress we've continued to make on the strategic priorities. These are the highest order imperatives that will enable us to meet our long-term financial commitments and set the company on a path of sustainable growth and expansion for many years to come.
1,"Nonetheless, we believe this is the right strategic move to optimize our long-term profitability for these segments, ultimately, building greater shareholder value over time. In summary, we are encouraged that our strategy is working as continued focus on leveraging our Loyalty Currency Retailing business has enabled us to continue to develop our new high growth opportunities resulting in strong growth in key metrics for 2018. As we indicated in our 2018 preview and we are reiterating today, we expect gross profit to accelerate materially in 2018, increasing in the range of 10% to 20%."
1,"Not materially. One of the things that we mentioned, I think it was in our strat plan meeting, investor meeting in last March, was a significant expansion in the breadth and probably depth as well of our long-term equity plan that was tied very closely to our three-year strategy plan targets. And that will continue."
1,"Not only does this allow us to serve more advertisers, it also helps us become a one-stop shop for those that continue to invest in our platform. Our strategy is paying off. For example, of the Top 100 Ad Age advertisers that started advertising with us in Q1 of 2016 or earlier, each one of them, at a parent level, also spent with us in 2017, and over 90% of them spent in every quarter of 2017."
1,"Notably, our recent acquisitions, combined with our lean and scalable model have further enhanced our operating leverage and our upside potential. Our capital allocation strategy remains disciplined and balanced. Since our spinoff, we have invested over $600 million in our fleet, including the six VLCCs and opportunistically repurchased shares during the year, given the discount to NAV per share."
1,"Nothing that I will call out on the call today, but I will tell you that this year, the beginning of   the end of 2017 we went through an extensive strategic planning process and we identified opportunities to grow and we do have those on our future plans. But nothing specific that we can call out today."
1,"Notwithstanding this, in the quarter, we consolidated two stores and continued to focus on driving profitable growth with specific initiatives to achieve long-term objectives and counterbalance some of our business challenges. We continue to drive our refinished business with both traditional and MSO customers while executing on our strategy to expand further into the Industrial Coatings business. We are seeing early signs of success for this initiative as we have secured some local and national accounts."
1,Now let's move onto the numbers. We expect our 2013 revenues to come with between $795 million to $815 million which represents a 1% to 3% growth over last year consistent with our strategy to grow revenues at or above the market rate. This is driven mainly by expect the continued growth in our cloud-based solutions and managed services offerings.
1,"Now let's take a look at 2018 on slide 11. As Lowell mentioned up front, our strategic priorities for 2018 are clear. Our focus is on executing on the fundamentals which positions the business for strong performance in the upcoming year."
1,"Now let's turn to Slide 15 and on my closing comments. As we close out the first half of fiscal year 2018, our results demonstrate the success we have had in transforming Carpenter as we continue to execute on our strategic plan and position the company for long-term growth. We continue to drive opportunities for expanding our market position as seen in our consistent backlog growth as we deepen our relationships with customers, demonstrate our value to new ones and unlock additional applications for our solutions."
1,"Now look at slide 7 in a bit of detail. Last year, we announced our strategic priorities with emphasis on disciplined growth and productivity improvement. We have a clear focus towards what we want to achieve by 2019 and we've specified our deliverables in 2017."
1,"Now on page 17, we talk a bit about payout, and I'd like to remind you of what we divulged in September concerning our payout practice. So in September 2017, we announced changes in our capital management practices aligned with our value creation strategy. First, we excluded the maximum payout limits that used to be 45% and maintain the practice of paying dividends and interest on capital of at least 35% of net income."
1,"Now turning to our Well Service business, as some of you know, Tom Alford joined Precision at the beginning of the year to lead our Well Services Group. Tom brings over 35 years of Canadian well service experience to Precision and he will be instrumental in our strategy as we continue to evolve this business. Now, while Precision is focused heavily on the cost side, Tom brings a broad leadership capability and will focus on strengthening our field operations, improving our customer exposure while continuing an intense focus on costs."
1,"Now when we think about that, I think, it would be foolish to say where we're going to invest that because the worldwide economy is going to go. So our strategy is how do we deploy that capital in areas where it is independent of the economy."
1,"Now, as a reminder, our direct-to-consumer and digital wholesale businesses account for about 85% of our 2021 growth plan. So it's very encouraging to see the strong performance and momentum across key pillars of our strategy. We remain intensely focused on fundamentals and quality growth, as evidenced by continued strength in our gross margin."
1,"Now, please move to the next slide for the strategic highlights in the first quarter. As you know, we have identified three key strategic initiatives, and we call them lighthouses, to support the long-term growth of Chr. Hansen."
1,"Now, the order of these priorities can change from time-to-time based for example on the opportunity set in front of us and our stock price. Currently, we are focused on the expansion of the venue portfolio and we see that as the centerpiece of our investment strategy. And we believe we have a unique opportunity to create long-term asset value for our shareholders through that expansion."
1,"Now, the performance of Icade in 2017 shows the relevance of our business model, an efficient business model as an integrated real estate player, and we will be showing this to you as we review these results and this performance, as I told you in my introductory remarks. Thanks to the strong support of the board of directors, Icade has been working on updating its strategic plan, especially its next phase that is from 2019 to 2023, knowing that we'll be presenting this next phase in the end of this first half of 2018. So much for my introductory remarks."
1,"Now, turning to our International business and the exciting progress we've made expanding our European infrastructure to support a successful transition of our Omnipod customers on July 1. We are hitting all of our key milestones in a very thoughtful and very thorough strategic plan and we're benefiting from the considerable expertise of our new European management team. Our newly hired team includes commercial leaders throughout various European geographies within the areas of sales, market access, customer service, and all other key support functions."
1,"Now, with a plan confirmation by the courts, we're focused on working with GenOn on transition services so that GenOn may be a standalone company by September of 2018. I want to acknowledge that 2017 was an important year for our company and we underwent a series of changes stemming from multiple strategic initiatives. I am very proud of our success in greatly simplifying our business and positioning ourselves to thrive under any market cycles."
1,"Nuclear generation is also an important non-emitting baseload resource. Prudently investing to preserve these valuable assets is an important part of our strategy to deliver sustainable value to all of our stakeholders. Our planned investments in new technologies to modernize our grid, such as advanced meters, will further improve efficiency."
1,"Number one, drive profitable growth; number two, integrate our key acquisitions, PAML, Mount Sinai, and Chiltern; number three, optimize our enterprise margins and as much as possible overcome the headwind from PAMA by using the Covance LaunchPad process and our cost discipline to offset as much as possible not entirely the impact of PAMA on the Diagnostics business. Then we have our three strategic initiatives that we'll talk about to capitalize on the long-term market opportunities and we'll discuss those today. So value-based care, as I mentioned, the enhancement of the Drug Development process, streamlining it and making it faster, better and cheaper for our pharmaceutical customers and embracing the role of the consumer and building a world-class consumer platform."
1,"number one, strong underlying performance of the business, that puts you in a position of ongoing growth, strong capital health, et cetera; two, well-positioned, diversified growth platforms, both of which presented optionality, as we've discussed in the past, so-called horizontally, vertically or otherwise. Our belief set and our passion is that this combination presents the best opportunity to further accelerate our strategy, to further improve affordability, because society needs a step function improvement in affordability that is delivered in a highly personalized fashion, having the consumer touch points, having the further depth in clinical engagement and having very importantly the ability to stand up an additional growth platform, creates an overwhelmingly attractive proposition. And that growth platform is a service-based business that will take the best of Express Scripts and Cigna's capabilities and bring those services to bear to expand alternatives for employers who want subsets of those services, health plans who want to further expand services to improve affordability and personalization for their customers, governmental agencies, and as well as over time, high-performing healthcare value-based physician collaboratives."
1,"Number one, we now have a healthy balance sheet and access to capital to meet our growth plans. We have availability under our credit facility and recently sold assets that no longer fit with our long-term strategic plans. As a result, we have the liquidity to fund much needed maintenance capital expenditures and selected growth opportunities."
1,"Obviously we're very pleased to deliver record revenue and see an acceleration in revenue growth in 2017. And as you know, as a company, our objectives have always been to balance that value and need for organic revenue growth with delivering industry-leading profitability. So we're pleased with the progress we made in 2017 on both those fronts."
1,"Obviously, the events of this month have meant that we've been in close contact with the banks and they remain extremely supportive. This strategy is being implemented and our principal lenders are behind that strategy. So, we're seeing no issues there."
1,"Obviously, there is a lot of growth potential beyond that as well. So, the long-term plan for Tobii Tech stretches much further than 2021 but reaching the profitability as a credible target in 2021, and even in 2020 we should of course see a good progress towards that target."
1,"Obviously, we're also looking for a decision in the AMPYRA patent appeal this year. In closing, our strategic priorities are to advance INBRIJA toward approval and commercialization, maximize the value of AMPYRA, which includes vigorous prosecution of the appeal and also continued financial discipline to ensure that we remain well capitalized. We will now take your questions."
1,"Of course, as always, I'll say this is a complex process but we believe that we have demonstrated it's doable. Last but not least, you have higher visibility and commitments on dividends, so the combination of all these elements according to us make this strategic plan extremely attractive. So thank you very much."
1,"Of course, in absolute value, I guess, you appreciate that the Lamps' free cash flow is lower. So the comment we've made in the strategic priorities is as a percentage of sale. But the absolute value for our Lamps is lower given the magnitude of the decrease of the sales and also the profit."
1,"Of course, we are bounded by pricing and value, which is something we're committed to make sure we're not doing deals just to build strategic holes in the pipeline but that make sense for our investors over the long-term. And I think we also want to think carefully about our strategy in oncology in what can complement existing assets and add to what we're doing versus just de novo efforts to enter a space. So given the price points in oncology, we are careful about our work, but I think it would be reasonable to expect a busy year in business development for oncology for Lilly."
1,"Of those employees, a net 439 left the company due to their two acquisitions and can, therefore, be counted as net staff synergies. Gross synergies would have been even higher, but we increased personnel to support our strategy and to expand functions that Nationale Swiss had outsourced, which acted as a counter-effect. Finally, changes in the group structure, for instance, the sale of the Belgian entity of Nationale Suisse on the one side and the acquisition of MoneyPark and Defferrard & Lanz on the other side, resulted in a further net decline of 35 full-time equivalents."
1,"Offsetting those to a degree were some headwinds associated with key contract renewals together with higher volume performance from our institutional segment both of which increased costs. During the fourth quarter of every year, we conduct an in-depth analysis of our performance against our strategic priorities and assess how we want to refine them for the upcoming year. As Glenn walked you through earlier, our strategic priorities for the year include delivering organic growth, improving operational excellence and reducing revenue volatility."
1,"Okay, great. Yeah, I was hoping to drill into a couple of the strategic initiatives that you mentioned. The first was mobile that's been an area of strength to Shutterfly, equals 20% of brand revenue."
1,"Okay. And then last question is your paying down debt strategy is reminiscent of pre-great recession time period when you were pretty early to kind of hunker down on your balance sheet. I also think or we also think that this sector needs some price discovery to maybe create some type of catalyst, maybe you get that with your ESL joint venture to some degree, but perhaps some other combinations, to what degree are you kind of reinforcing your balance sheet with an eye towards some of the major dislocation of stock price performance in your group today?"
1,"Okay. And then the second question is   sort of the bigger-picture question is, there's a lot of moving pieces to what you're talking about with your   and thanks so much for laying out the six pieces of the strategic planning, some of which are adding costs in the near-term as different revenue drivers get work. I guess a sense for all of us on the call of how much is undoing older initiatives, whether it's around IT, some of the things that were already started certainly in merchandising or in the in-store presentation or the digital?"
1,"Okay. And then we noticed obviously, your acquisition of your partners' ownership share of your Santa Barbara portfolio, do you have any long-term plans for that park, it's obviously, it's a little bit different in terms of its functionality versus the rest of your portfolio."
1,"Okay. And then you already mentioned that question around sulfur, because what is your strategy of buying right now? You quote some MRs et cetera."
1,"Okay. And then, Todd, maybe just to offer some of your thoughts on where you're thinking about M&A at this point, activity in the market, potential activity in the market or how as you build out kind of a strategic plan over the next couple years how you see M&A fitting into that?"
1,Okay. My other question was sir around distribution and you know your sales strategy. So when you said you opened two regional offices Patna and one more place and growth has been strong.
1,"Okay. So you outlined some of the tenets of that strategic plan on the call, right, it was expansion in Europe, it was blockchain. Can you wrap any numbers around it?"
1,"Olivier will then provide more detail on the financials and discuss our first quarter and full year 2018 outlook. Anders will conclude with progress made on Zebra's strategic priorities. Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Senior Vice President of Global Sales will join us as we take your questions."
1,"On a smaller stock, smaller base, that's our plan. As Miguel mentioned, we're working on a mid-long-term plan and on a more granular NPL plan. The communication of that will be then only in the second semester of the year, probably only on the second semester of the year because that's the time either before summer or after summer."
1,"On asset management, I mean I think today's announcement is really exciting but it's a long-term development, and we're absolutely aware that it takes time firstly to deploy the capital that we've announced in today's partnership program, but also to build that track record that would enable us then to raise other funds on a discretionary basis from accounts in the future. So, a meaningful development but it's a long-term plan, and we'll support our ambition to grow asset management revenues strongly over the long term. We don't, as you know at the moment, break out the asset management division separately."
1,"On behalf of my Coupa colleagues and myself, we warmly thank all those in our industry who have taken the time to fully understand our vision and support it. Now, one previously discussed component of our growth strategy is to consider acquiring key assets to further expand the depth and breadth of our offering while simultaneously investing heavily into organic R&D. Continuing our execution in this strategic area, in December, we announced our acquisition of Simeno based in Basel, Switzerland."
1,"On EXO Technologies, I mean this follows on the back of your V2X and over-the-air update capabilities that were acquired from Arada Systems and Autonet. Can you kind of help us understand what the strategic plan is with these assets and what incremental capabilities you might need to execute upon your vision?"
1,"On immigration, we're definitely watchful of any developments on the policy front that could impact us, and always, we'll comply with laws and regulations in whichever jurisdiction we're operating. I think, while we await some clarity there, where   we have a long-term plan, we're investing in local hiring, campus hiring programs and definitely working to ensure that our customers don't experience any service interruption regardless of the policy."
1,"On Kurla, in the last quarter as well as in the nine months, we've seen some stark improvement both in terms of consumption growth and in rental growth. If you can just highlight key strategic initiatives that you have taken to materialize this growth that will help?"
1,"On MonDocteur, as you said previously, we are open on any strategic initiative which could be interesting for us, but there is nothing, no deal, nothing done at all. We have just a general analysis of all opportunities, which could appear to result strategic issue for press and give us the possibility of cost synergies and for growth."
1,"On pricing, Mig, we have   first of all last year, when we met with customers and channel partners around the world, rolling out pretty much the strategic plan and all the initiatives, we committed at that point in time of not increasing prices for the first half of 2018. I think, now looking at the overall trend we see in the industry and obviously also some pressure on the commodity side, we are analyzing the situation and we could see probably a price increase during the second half of 2018."
1,"On the call are Victor Herrero, Chief Executive Officer; and Sandeep Reddy, Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, the company will be making forward-looking statements, including comments regarding future plans, strategic initiatives, capital allocation and short and long-term financial outlook. The company's actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on risk factors included in today's press release and the company's quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC."
1,"On the CapEx profile, in the markets where we're operating actually we're seeing a rise in the CapEx, we are not seeing a decline. So, if you look, for instance, at Saudi Arabia, they announced a strategic plan, it's mostly gas. They are going with a very, very ambitious plan on the gas side."
1,"On the commercial side, new loan opportunities are up 28% compared with last year. Our strategy of building our core loan portfolio, which we define as loan relationships under $10 million in size, continues to help provide steady sustainable organic growth. For 2017, new commitments under $10 million accounted for 47% of the total volume for the full year."
1,"On the corporate culture side, particularly the focus on continuous improvement that will be at center stage because we also believe that we see further potential in terms of cost management to compensate external headwinds. So, in essence, we are not immune to the external market environment, however we think our strategy is spot on and we will continue to diligently and in a disciplined fashion execute this strategy. Now, if we look then at this potpourri of different factors, we have on the one side, I think, just general positive macro environment with, I think, growth projected by the IMF of 3."
1,"On the crude gathering side, we're projecting 50% volume growth during 2018 over 2017 average volumes. Our third growth strategy is to build scale in the Delaware Basin. In the Delaware, we saw very attractive volume growth during 2017, with an approximately 300% increase in average processing and gathering volumes year-over-year."
1,"On the growth front, so far in 2018, we have invested approximately $130 million in new homes, primarily through our traditional channels, and we are now targeting $400 million to $600 million of acquisitions in 2018. Most of our incremental capital for the balance of this year will be allocated to our newly constructed built-for-rental product which we believe provides the best risk-adjusted returns in the near and long terms, and is consistent with our objectives to grow both strategically and accretively. Our construction activity will include the piloting of new rental communities."
1,"On the heels of our many accomplishments in 2017, Foundation Medicine is poised to continue growing the business while changing the landscape of cancer care as we know it today. To that end, I'd like to outline our strategic priorities for 2018. First, we plan the commercially-launched FoundationOne CDx once the NCD is finalized."
1,"On the next slide, we will demonstrate how we believe we are well positioned to capture that upswing by having a tightly focused strategy. Moving on to slide 15, we've presented our strategic priorities before and we continue to drive these to ensure revenue growth in the company. Our strategic priorities are reviewed regularly based upon our analysis of the resource and energy markets and where we see the greatest demand for our services."
1,"On the next slide, you can see I'm pleased with the solid results for the quarter. Our strategic initiatives are on track, leading to better service to our clients at lower costs. We have had a record year in terms of profitability helped by the Dutch economy, which is performing very well."
1,"On the phone this afternoon with me are Bob Roche, our Chief Financial Officer; and Titus Ball, our Chief Accounting Officer. On today's call, I will discuss our full year and fourth quarter 2017 performance, our 2018 outlook, introduce our new strategic plan and discuss the food service divesture. Bob will review the impact of changes to the U."
1,"On to international. Our strategy is evolving under the direction of the new leadership. The result is an increased focus on core markets, where we are well-positioned to achieve scale and drive clinical and financial value."
1,"On top of the higher base we achieved this year, 2018 guidance is well on track with our three-year targets we shared in February 2017 as well as in line with our goal to grow the top-line above inflation. In 2018, our top priority is to continue executing on our digital strategy with a view to gaining additional share of our customers, 1440 minutes in a day. I will now leave the floor to our Chief Financial Officer, BÃ¼lent."
1,"On top of this, this year, because I am happy to comment what's going to happen this year. This year, we're going to pay back the two maturities of the subordinated debt for a total amount of â‚¬250 million and we're going to pay back this as a cash payment with no refinancing of these and then to   we'll be happy to exchange with you on the buyback M&A debt and capital on November 21, in Milan, because this is definitely, this will be definitely a significant part of our new strategic plan."
1,"On your question regards to marketing and selling expenses on the Hearing side, you see that in the fourth quarter 2017 or 2016 basically it was flattish, there was no increase. So what you see over here is a year-over-year comparison that you also correctly stated and that was driven by two factors; A) Our 2017 to 2019 strategy where we said that we are driving Commercial Excellence, execution and therefore we had to increase in   one or the other area, of course, also the impact in order to drive for top-line growth. So that was a one-time investment basically that is now on that level healthy."
1,"Once again, our conservative underwriting and the low risk nature of our portfolios was evident in our low credit provision. We also made progress on our key strategic initiatives, including the creation of the new Corporate & Investment Bank as an integrated organization to allow more seamless delivery of transaction banking, advisory, and capital markets activity to our core client. The legal merger of Postbank and Deutsche Bank's domestic Private & Commercial Bank, which we still expect to be finalized in the second quarter of 2018, and in Asset Management, we've largely completed the legal and operational preparation for the planned partial flotation of DWS."
1,"Once the document is signed and we have the final terms and conditions, then I can   I will be more than happy to share with you the final decision. But until the documents are signed, it will be counterproductive for the each party right now to speculate how the impact would happen, similar to the strategic plans. There are very substantial and far reaching strategic plans related to Magnit."
1,"Once we very much focused on our core, the other one looking at the future, where do we want to be in terms of M&A, how do we use technology toward our customer, what does mobility hold for the future, some more to come on that. And finally I'll end with before handing it over to our core strategic initiatives as we think about the business. So first and foremost, it's executing on our brand vision."
1,"One is further on the care delivery side. And just thinking about your value-based care strategy, and I'm trying to understand if your market share makes it easier and more attractive or less attractive to own providers in those markets? And then the second question is really related to your cross-selling efforts and focus, in particular in the self-insured market."
1,"One is higher market and performance-driven expenses. Second is higher regulatory-driven expenses and then last but not least is just the continued implementation of our strategic plan in light of tax reform, in light of strong markets as well as the early successes of the investments that we've been making. The midpoint of that range is our central tendency for 2018 and expense growth could get to the high end of the range if markets and our relative performance are particularly strong and to the lower end of the range, if markets in our own relative performance were to be particularly weak."
1,"One of our themes for S&W since I took over as CEO has been evolving beyond recap. The four key items I just discussed will be keys to our strategy going forward. Number one, evolve beyond our dependence on alfalfa seed operations, which is comprised of vast majority of our business since inception."
1,"One was in the microfinance side and I was looking at the way our presence has expanded, particularly in the last couple of quarters. So, what's our strategy in the UP market? I mean it's kind of more than doubled in last five quarters."
1,"One, enhance the growth trajectory and profitability of our core microbubble franchise; two, augment and invest in our pipeline with focus on emerging technologies; and three, pursue external opportunities that fit our objective to deliver sustainable growth and profitability. We are excited about our prospects and believe we are investing in the right strategic priorities today to ensure a strong and healthy growth profile that will maximize long-term success for our company and value for our shareholders. I would like to emphasize, we remain continually committed to operational excellence and the optimization of our current business."
1,"Only that we're continuing to work with each of these customers on what's the right answer for them based on their network plan. And as I said, we're trying to find that common ground between our objectives and theirs. Eventually, in our history, we've tended to be able to do that, but I would also invite you to look at two other gauges in the cockpit, which are Big Four churn in the United States, which we offer every quarter now in our results and the average length of contract with the Big Four carriers in the United States."
1,"Operating EBITDA also includes a $5 million decrease in earnings from costs related to our share of the startup of operations of our mortgage joint venture Guaranteed Rate Affinity. Corporate expenses before restructuring, legacy, and early extinguishment of debt in 2017 was $35 million greater than 2016 due to higher expenses relating to investments in technology, development, professional fees, supporting strategic initiatives, as well as an $8 million legal settlement and an $8 million in CEO transition costs. Now, I'd like to make some broader comments."
1,"Organic generation of capital for next year, well, everything that has to do with the future and mid-term forecast, we look at that when we present the strategic plan. The organic generation of the bank will continue to be good I believe because the model will continue to work well, and we'll give you more details when we look at the strategic plan when we present it."
1,Organic operating profit grew by a very solid 8. 4% and this included investments of DKK 500 million in our strategic priorities. Adjusted net results grew by a strong 27%.
1,"Organic revenue growth has begun to accelerate and order momentum supports further improvement in 2018. Margins have improved for the first time since 2010, as growth and the financial benefits from our strategic initiatives starts to offset the headwinds. And initial reductions in inventory and further progress on research and development programs have contributed to an excellent year for cash, up 42%."
1,"Our 2017 dividend was 3 times our first dividend declared in 2011, and we've now declared close to $6. 5 billion of dividends in total as a result of our profitable growth strategy. Finally, we've also captured a number of additional growth opportunities such as strategic bancassurance partnerships and acquisitions while maintaining our financial discipline."
1,"Our 2018 non-GAAP outlook anticipates 4% to 6% revenue growth, up to 20 basis points of operating margin expansion, and up to 7% to 10% non-GAAP net income growth driven by the Columbia, SOREL, and prAna brands and in all four of our geography regions. We believe that the combination of our global, multi-brand, multi-channel business, our sound strategic plan, and our teammates around the world form a solid foundation that will continue to drive growth, expand our profitability, and increase our total return to shareholders in the years ahead. You can find more detail on our Q4 and four-year results and our 2018 outlook in Jim's   CFO commentary available on our website."
1,"Our 2018 plan reflects an emphasis on execution, ongoing improvements in top line growth and continued actions to expand our margins. And as we develop our strategic plan for sustainable growth, we are focused on how we can optimize and accelerate our strength to create more value for all our stakeholders. As a leader, my philosophy has always been to set thoughtful goals and deliver against them."
1,"Our acquisition of HealthSun, and pending acquisition of America's 1st Choice, demonstrates this focus. Both of these companies fit well into our larger strategy, well-run Medicare assets in strategic locations, which we can further grow and scale. As a company, we remain committed to achieving our long-term earnings per share target growth range of upper single to low double-digits, with a focus on generating sustainable, high-quality earnings."
1,"Our Acumedia operations located here in Lansing produce culture media products for a number of different applications and as John mentioned, because of the need for worldwide supply, we added to that capability, the Lab M operations near Manchester, England, about 18 months ago. I think you can see by these examples, how we are growing our international business with a very strategic plan. International sales for the second quarter were $38."
1,"Our Advanced Materials are enabling customers to solve their most challenging problems. Our profitable growth strategy focused on commercial and operational excellence, innovation and acquisitions is gaining traction. We made significant investments and driven organizational changes to further execute on our strategy."
1,"Our ambition is very much to be the most influential and most innovative luxury group worldwide in terms of creative boldness, social and environmental responsibility, as well as economic performance. Our objectives of value creation and our financial ambitions which guide and validate our operating strategy remain unchanged, of course. Our priority continues to be organic growth for all of our brands with growth rates that we want to be substantially above those of industry averages."
1,"Our analysis shows that over the remaining life of the portfolio, we expect to potentially incur up to $2 million in total incremental losses, over and above the losses we would have expected when the company made the original decision to enter the Transportation channel in 2015. The swift action we took to change our entire Transportation strategy and underwriting has significantly mitigated future negative impacts on the company. Based on the size of the Transportation portfolio, the projected negative variance in the Transportation 1."
1,"Our balance sheet continues to be a meaningful source of value creation, which is evident in the actions announced by our board today. That leaves us well positioned to deliver on our objectives for the full year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Michael."
1,"Our balance sheet remains very healthy. With that, I'd like to turn the floor back to Nancy to give you an update on our strategic priorities and talk about guidance for 2018. I'd like to remind you that our guidance for 2018 is based on our new IFRS 15 standards."
1,Our biggest priority today is television station M&A that improve the performance of our entire portfolio. Our corporate strategy is focused on serving the consumer of today and tomorrow in whatever the way they choose to find news and information. We are completely focused on delivering short-term results while at the same time working to build long-term value.
1,"Our board has today approved the financial results of ICICI Bank for the quarter ended 31st December, 2017. The bank continues to make progress on the strategic priorities that we had outlined in our 4x4 agenda, which covers portfolio quality and enhancing franchise. I would just like to highlight a few areas pertaining to this quarter in that context."
1,"Our business is about innovating ways to supplant 1G, one gigabit Ethernet connections and replaces them with Multi-Gig capability. Our strategy is focused on bringing to market the solution set that promotes this transition. We believe there is tremendous headroom to get from the current deployment level of Multi-Gig to the almost 1 billion port opportunities that that defines 17-year old gigabit technology."
1,"Our business model as a result of what we Pat demonstrated in EBIT and so on actually works with the channel. And I think there's   and we are working on a number of strategic initiatives to build that out. One example is as we go to the cloud, we just this quarter have begun to sign up master agents."
1,"Our business model is working and we are even more excited as we look forward and expect to reap the benefits of our past investments in cardiovascular, neurological, pediatric, metabolic, exome and our new investments in maternal and reproductive health as we grow our business further. Our business success in 2016 and leading in the 2017 gave us the confidence to add M&A to our growth strategy. We acquired AltaVoice in January 2017, launching the Invitae Patient Network in April 2017, as an integrated part of our business development efforts."
1,"Our CEO will then demonstrate how we are executing our growth strategy across the group. Handing over to our Chief Commercial Officer, Lorenzo Mariani, who will show how our new enhanced commercial strategy will drive new sales in key international markets all across the group and then our CFO, Alessandra Genco, will show the economic and financial side of our plan, the reasons and drivers behind it, and what it takes us in economic and financial terms. After some concluding remarks by the CEO, we will look forward to taking your questions in a Q&A session."
1,"Our clients will benefit from the automation of service management, capacity on-demand and fast provisioning, all delivered in a fully secure FIS environment. As a final point in our investment strategy recap, I'd like to comment on our capital deployment strategy considering the immediate and positive impacts resulting from the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We are focused on a multi-year plan and anticipate adding $650 million to $700 million in cash flow over the next three years as a result of this legislation, enabling us to positively contribute to the economy focused on the long-term interest of our shareholders, clients, and employees, all of which achieve the intended goals of the tax legislation."
1,"Our company strategy has been to develop new treatment options for orphan and age-related diseases in back of the eye. Genetic mutations are the cause of most orphan inherited retinal degenerative diseases, and therefore, it is only natural for us to look into novel and differentiated gene therapy opportunities to fulfill our strategy. Further, gene therapy may decrease the treatment burden in age-related retinal indications."
1,"Our core tobacco businesses delivered strong income growth and expanded their already high margins despite a year that presented some unique challenges in each business. We also, in 2017, accomplished several important strategic initiatives for future success, including making significant progress toward our goal of becoming the U. S."
1,"Our credit outlook remains positive for 2018, and we expect loan losses to be below 2% throughout the year consistent with what we experienced in the second half of 2017. Now, I'd like to spend a few moments discussing three strategic initiatives that we have going on within KAR. Let me start by stating that our industries continue to evolve, and I believe that we are making the investments and dedicating the resources to ensure that we are a leader in this evolution."
1,"Our current investment cycle positions us for significant visible EBITDA growth in 2019 and beyond, which is why this is a very exciting time at Targa. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt and Matt will provide an update around the execution of our strategic priorities and an update on our business fundamentals. Matt?"
1,"Our customers are seeing the benefits of Triumph's transformation, and I'm confident about our ability to translate this progress into shareholder value creation. Now before we get into the details of the quarter on page 3, I'll recap the five imperatives we set for FY 2018 towards our objectives of predictable profitability and positive cash flow. First, eliminate program cost overruns."
1,"Our customers remain our priority. We continue to develop our strategy, given more options to passengers to customize their trip and to improve their travel experience through the entire process. AndrÃ©s del Valle will explain later in more detail these aspects."
1,"Our execution on these five priorities gives us confidence that we have reached an inflection point in our turnaround, and that our actions over the past few years and particularly throughout 2017 have positioned us for accelerating growth and profitability. Looking forward to 2018, let me similarly share the five key strategic initiatives for our team. Priority number one; deliver 20% plus year-over-year growth in both the number of new logos and the total value of closed sales."
1,"Our focus is clearly on delivering long-term earnings growth, which we can do organically. I'd also mention that currently we think our stock is undervalued, and we believe that transaction multiples are currently   continue to be pretty excessive and would not allow us to achieve our objectives in any M&A kind of scenario."
1,"Our focus on material reengineering and continuous improvement through lean enables us to profitably grow our base business while maintaining and expanding our strong returns. Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered both strong top line growth and significant margin expansion driven by the execution of our transformation strategy and continued strength in RFID. In terms of the base business, sales increased across most product lines and multiple customer categories, including performance athletic, premium, and fast fashion."
1,"Our fourth quarter and 2017 full year results demonstrate the progress we've made in all of these areas. Slide 3 of the slides we uploaded highlight many of these accomplishments, and I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight examples of successes we had last year relating to these priorities and emphasize why we believe these strategic priorities have us well positioned to deliver ongoing strong operating and financial performance. The first area I mentioned is our focus on investing in our assets to generate strong returns and sustainably reduce our costs."
1,"Our goal is to be below 60% every year. In 2018, we plan to continue execution of our long-term strategy to convert a portion of our marketable securities into loans. And lastly, we expect that the effective tax rate for 2018 will be within a range of 19% to 21%."
1,"Our goal is to improve our high level of return on invested capital. We believe the combination of our disciplined capital spending and our ONETractor strategic plans will provide us with the opportunity to expand our return on invested capital over time. Looking out, our target is to achieve anywhere from a range of 120 to 180 basis points improvement in return on invested capital through the combination of improved sales and profitability, and a disciplined approach to both working capital and our capital spending."
1,"Our goal is to optimize our broader cellulose specialties product offering and global asset base factoring in our customer needs and transportation efficiencies to drive higher value for our customers and for our company. The third pillar of our strategy is new product innovation, which remains a key priority for the company. Our focus is on making commercially attractive products that can drive growth in our existing businesses as well as provide us entry into other attractive and faster-growing segments."
1,"Our goals are consistent and simple. They're consistent year-over-year from the initiatives we put in and our strategic plan back in 2016. Focus on shareholder values through deployment of the cash on the balance sheet, use leverage when it's appropriate and disciplined, strategic growth through deployment of our capital, utilizing our quality relationships with our developers."
1,"Our guidance for the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework is different, 2016 to 2019 we expected to do between $1 billion and $3 billion in M&A, most of that in Optical Communications. When we complete the acquisition for $900 million of 3M's Communications Markets Division, we're going to be up around $1."
1,"Our Halloween business which includes Disney Princess, Nintendo characters, Minecraft, PJ Mask, LEGO Ninjago, Descendants 2 to name a few is doing very well in sell-through, thanks to Amazon's Pay by Click and Deal of the Day programs. Our strategy of building our own IP has also paid off in the fourth quarter. Some of the biggest contributors were from Real Workin' Buddies, Squish-Dee-Lish, Unicone Rainbow Swirl Maker, Chocolate Egg Surprise, and Pull My Finger, all of which are poised to carry forward and have a great 2018."
1,"Our high quality unsecured portfolio represents just 6% of total loans, and our runoff assets are down by over 95% since 2010, and comprised just 2% of loans and advances, and finally, have very limited exposure to high volatility business lines. At our last strategy update, we talked about a through the cycle AQR of around 40 basis points. Going forward, IFRS 9 will obviously introduce greater short-term volatility, and the acquisition of MBNA will also add around 4 basis points to our annual charge."
1,"Our immediate priorities for this half are to implement our new head office and franchisee support structures, as well as continue to deliver supply chain and cost of good savings to benefit franchisees. We are focused on reducing net debt, and in the context of simplifying our business model are reviewing our broader brand strategy and portfolio to ensure enhanced back-office structures that help us become a more integrated organization and one that better supports franchisees. Longer term, we need to change the culture of our organization to one that is focused on doing the basics better."
1,"Our mission is to be our customers' partner of choice for photonics products. Turning to slide number 6, joining forces with Oclaro is highly aligned with our strategy. Our telecom businesses are very complementary and combining them drives scale, enhanced customer relevance, along with the ability to invest more in the longer term in more fundamental technologies, especially at the chip level."
1,"Our near-term initiatives are focused on reducing expenses and stabilizing profits to support our long-term goals of growing the business through new stores and expanding our omni-channel capabilities. To position our business for growth, the foundation of our strategic plan is built on four pillars. One, strengthen the core; two, improving profitability; three, accelerating execution; and finally, number four, innovating for the future."
1,"Our occupancy has reached sustainable levels, and we're focused on improving our tenancy mix and maximizing our lease renewals, albeit at sustainable levels for our tenants. We've built solid foundations to enable us to continue to seek out and execute on our growth opportunities that are also consistent with our strategy and risk profile. I'd now like to invite any questions."
1,"Our philosophy is to build our business for both the short and the long term. To do that, we invest in talent to deliver for customers and to achieve our strategic priorities while applying our financial principles to assess which investments are best to make. When we look at where we are today, we believe our fiscal year 2018 operating plan already includes the right mix of investments in employees, technology, and product development to benefit our customers."
1,"Our plans call for investing in more than 25 new facilities over the next four years to drive this result, expanding our unparalleled national footprint to serve locations that do not currently have access to our higher-margin products. In addition to growing our value-added products, our strategic plan includes execution of operational excellence, cost saving initiatives including distribution and logistics, pricing and margin optimization, back-office efficiencies, and system enhancements that are designed to contribute between $65 million and $75 million, an incremental annual EBITDA once fully implemented. The scope and scale of our existing infrastructure, customer base and logistical capabilities means that improvements and efficiency, when replicated across our network, can yield substantial profit margin expansion."
1,"Our presenters today are Bob Cagnazzi, our Chief Executive Officer; and Neil Johnston, our Chief Financial Officer. Bob will begin with his perspective on the second quarter performance and provide a discussion on our ongoing strategic initiatives. Neil will then review our financial results and future outlook in more detail before we open up the call for your questions."
1,"Our previous record level of cash flow from operations was $367 million in 2015, and we estimate we could far exceed that amount in 2018 and approach over $500 million in cash flow from operations. Given that view, in terms of capital usage priorities, as we've indicated in the past, we continually evaluate the expected investment return associated with acquisitions and other strategic initiatives to grow our operations, as well as share repurchase opportunities and the use of funds for debt reduction. As a reminder, we have a remaining open share repurchase authorization of approximately $98 million after accounting for approximately $2 million of share repurchases completed during the fourth quarter of 2017 at an average price of just under $40."
1,"Our priorities haven't changed. So, you won't be surprised to hear that the second half is about more of the same, implementing these strategic priorities that I've previously outlined, to help grow the allocation of superannuation funds to secure and stable retirement incomes, we'll continue to contribute to the government's reform agenda as the thought leader in the sector. In our Life business, I'm proud that we are the market leader in retirement incomes."
1,"Our projections as of today currently indicate that we will have difficulty maintaining compliance with future quarter covenants, starting with our fiscal fourth quarter. We have had preliminary discussions with our lead bank, and will be working with the entire bank group to maintain good standing with them and to maintain adequate liquidity as we continue to move our strategic initiatives forward in an attempt to build sustainable improvement in our financial results. To be clear, we are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants."
1,"Our properties are well-positioned to benefit as Western Canada continues to recover and occupancy is up significantly in Eastern Canada. In terms of our growth strategy, we have the balance sheet flexibility to be net acquirers during 2018. Our investment criteria demands assets that would be above the average quality of our portfolio offer a good growth profile and be accretive to DIR."
1,"Our salaries are well above the industrial average and significantly above the service sector. So, it's a mix upgrade just like in our strategy if you think about America and what we're doing. So, we think tax is great."
1,"Our sales teams get involved earlier in the innovation process to bring in more channel expertise and our supply chain teams are becoming more agile with much greater use of third-party manufacturing. Alongside innovation, a critical element of our strategy is to continue to develop the portfolio through what we call bolt-on M&A. So that shifts us more quickly towards future trends and it increases our exposure to higher growth segments."
1,"Our second strategy is to lead innovation. We believe our depth and breadth of high-quality innovation added an extraordinary value sets us apart from other brands, and is the linchpin of our strategy. Over the past four years, we progressed from around 40 launches a year to over 120, shortened our average time to market from 32 weeks to 22 weeks, and increased our gross margins from 47% to 61%."
1,"Our solid balance sheet and expected cash flows from operations enables us to continue to pursue growth through acquisitions and other investments that leverage our strengths and are strategically aligned with our core business vision. We are executing well against our strategic plan that combines diversification and integration. Through acquisitions and organic growth, we are a much broader, deeper and certainly more valuable organization than we were just a few years ago."
1,"Our specialty finance strategies are less correlated to the liquid credit markets, have a differentiated risk return profile that is complementary to our cash flow lending and afford us greater flexibility to stick to our investment discipline. In fact, importantly, distributions from our strategic initiatives have helped grow SUNS' weighted average portfolio yield as evidenced by the 120 basis point increase year-over-year. In light of the spread compression in the credit markets that occurred during 2017, we are particularly pleased with this accomplishment."
1,"Our strategy is clear, fully understood and endorsed by our people who are actually driving its successful execution and implementation. Being part of the company for quite some time, I was also part of the team that has worked on the creation of our strategic plan. And I strongly believe that our strategic choices are the right ones to help us drive sustainable growth."
1,"Our strong performance in 2017, along with the recent conversion and integration of Metropolitan, had positioned us well at the start of 2018. The expected future benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and continued focus on our key strategic initiatives will contribute to the further success in 2018. Now, Rachel, I'll turn the call back over to you for questions-and-answers."
1,"Our success in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017 was not simply the result of a strong economy. Throughout the company, the strategic initiatives we have been focused on for the last several years are paying off. Our marketing refinements are driving growth in gaming revenues and greater efficiency in our marketing spend."
1,Our team made great progress in 2017 and we are building a solid foundation for future growth. We will continue to invest in the business across our ONETractor strategy while moving fast but deliberately to capture efficiencies that will in turn drive profitable growth. I'll now turn the call over to Kurt to review our financial results for the quarter and the year.
1,"Our teams are continuing to work diligently to further optimize the remaining real estate obligations associated with these teach-out campuses and our teach-out strategy remains largely complete. Most importantly, the completion of our teach-out campuses frees up incremental resources to allocate towards investments in technology and student initiatives, intended to further our objectives of achieving responsible growth and improving student experiences, retention and academic outcomes. Now, with that, I'll hand the call over to Ashish for a more detailed review around our results, balance sheet and outlook."
1,"Our tenured brand equity continues to be driven by our team's relentless focus in our customers and the continuous innovation of industry-leading products, both of which has built a loyal and broad distribution base. Our 2017 results demonstrate that our teams remain focused on long-term vision and strategic priorities. In 2017, we continued to improve our financial strength by delivering free cash flow of nearly $34 million."
1,"Our third quarter results and updated fiscal year 2018 guidance further reaffirms our confidence in achieving the plan. Before handing the call over for Q&A, I would like to say how proud I am of the progress the entire organization has made on our long-term plans. Our focus remains the same going into calendar 2018, generating healthy, profitable growth to drive shareholder value and returns on capital."
1,"Our total contract mix will have almost 60% fixed price and time and materials type contracts, which is a key to higher margins. Our strategy will be to focus the CSRA outcome-based solution model on our GDIT portfolio to further improve our industry-leading margins. Chart 9 depicts lines of business that represent buckets that we use to sort the various services we provide for purposes of describing what we do."
1,"Our track record demonstrates our ability to do just that. In closing, our ONETractor Strategy provides us with a clear strategic direction and goals that support our future growth. We are making investments today that we expect will have a strong return in the future."
1,"Our VCI and Fresh incremental sales totaled about $90 million, despite having to replace Fresh and VCI's volume, resulting from the Circle K East and Kroger transition. These two strategic initiatives are a great importance to our C-store retailers as their profits feel the pressure of continuing cigarette carton declines. It is vital to our customers to take costs out of their supply chain, while also providing their consumer with the products they want."
1,"Outlook, we are very confident of delivering a very robust business performance driven by healthy demand in Specialty Pharmaceuticals-Injectable and favorable pricing environment in LSI segment. We expect our strategic initiatives in capacity enhancements, new product launches, enhancing process efficiencies are going to help us to deliver a strong performance going forward in Q4 FY 2018 and FY 2019. We continue our efforts to generate higher operating cash flows and utilize the same for marginal expansion and reduction of debt to further strengthen the balance sheet with improved financial ratios."
1,"Outside of the domestic Mid-Cap space, the flows we have seen over the last five years reflect sustainable demand for high value-added active strategies with compelling track records. Turning to slide 5, just like our investment strategy line-up, we are confident in our approach to distribution and how we deliver our investment capabilities to clients. We have always expected to sink or swim on the basis of investment results, not distribution or marketing might."
1,"Over the course of 2018, we'll continue to engage with other lenders, both current and existing customers, regarding the provision of capital and risk management solutions. We'll also continue to roll out our strategic initiatives identified as part of the Strategic Program of Work, which includes cost efficiencies and underwriting enhancements. We'll keep the market updated on the progress we're making throughout the year."
1,"Over the last several quarters, we've highlighted favorable industry trends and leading economic indicators that are creating conditions for improving scrap and steel markets. We are successfully executing on our strategic initiatives to capitalize on these improved markets, and our financial and operational performance this quarter is a continuation of the trend of strong performance we have been steadily delivering. We remain on a positive trajectory towards meeting or exceeding our fiscal 2019 volume and margin goals."
1,"Over the next 12 months, we will continue to focus on sustaining core growth trends and maintain our focus on long-term strategic development. These two goals define the strength of our strategy and will ultimately drive long-term value of our company. Growth of net new relationships and maximizing return on dollars invested in new products and processes will ultimately drive continued earnings growth for our company."
1,"Over the next three months, I'll meet with several of our clients, partners and employees and work with our leadership team and the board to validate our assumptions and approach around these elements. In April, I plan to conclude this exercise by outlining our strategic priorities and reconfirming our capital allocation plan. We will have an Investor Day in April to share this."
1,"Over the next three years with our capital plan, we'll add somewhere around 2,000 beds to our operating portfolio. So it's very important, like Bill said, to deal with some of the population growth that we're seeing in these markets, to really create better services for emergency room patients and ultimately, execute our full strategy."
1,"Over the past few years, we've committed significant resources to become more of a technology-driven company. One example of this philosophy is our Clicks-to-Bricks consumer banking strategy through the deployment of solution centers and iPads for account opening across our branches to help customers learn and select the best products for their needs. Another example is our online banking platform, where we've upgraded our capabilities, so our customers can begin applications online and schedule in-person consultations in the branch."
1,"Over the past year, we've talked with you about our strategy to grow the business through a focused effort to expand our customer base. We've identified three key components of this strategy that are best summed up in what we refer to as our 3P Strategy   Platform, Products, and Programs. After laying the groundwork for this strategy throughout 2017, we're now beginning to deliver and execute on this plan and while many of the initiatives associated with our growth strategy are in their early phases, I'm pleased to report solid growth on all three fronts which Ryan will address in more detail in a moment."
1,"Over time, we've discussed a number of cost reduction initiatives, and I want to simplify the way that we talk about our comprehensive productivity agenda and do it in consistent terms that will make it easy for everyone to understand exactly what we're doing. Last year, we introduced you to our OpEx 2020 framework, where we shared with you our plant and route efficiency work that was under our operational excellence strategic plan pillar, where we targeted between $80 million and $100 million in productivity annually. This year, we're challenging ourselves to do more."
1,"Overall, I'm pleased with our 2017 financial results and our progress on executing our strategy for growth and improving cash flow. Our recent announcements have gotten AquaVenture off to a great start for 2018 and we will continue to look for ways to expand our existing relationships and explore new strategic initiatives. I would like to thank our shareholders for continuing to believe in our management team and our company for their ongoing support."
1,"Overall, this is an exciting time of transition for our company. We're pleased with the progress we've made on all of our strategic initiatives. And I'll let Brian take you through the numbers in a little more detail."
1,"Overall, we are pleased with the momentum we have established across our business. We continue to execute on our key strategic priorities delivering strong growth, exceptional underwriting and significant expense savings. We fully expect these actions will position our company to continue to generate sustainable earnings growth over time."
1,"Overall, we are very much on track in terms of concluding our restructuring plan, this year, as agreed with the European Commission, with only the divestures of our banks in Bulgaria and Albania pending. Last but not least, I must mention that I feel very proud that we are executing our strategic plan under the auspices of a strong international board of directors and the establishment of a fully renewed set of principles, implementing highest corporate governance practices and controls. Moving on to page 6, I want to summarize our strategic path to full normalization and delivery of attractive returns to our shareholders."
1,"Overall, we see the service business growing its margin while also growing volume. Going forward in the strategic plan, we   again, I made the comment earlier, we go show   we'll show additional information at the Capital Market Day for the very good performance in quarter one of our service business. You need to take into account the seasonal effect in."
1,"Overall, we're pleased with our performance in 2017, having delivered on the goals we set for ourselves and positioned the business for continued progress through 2018. As ever, we tightly manage the business, directing our capital towards strategic priorities that underpin our long-term strategic growth plan. Now I'll turn the call over to Scott."
1,"PANTHER has been deployed at five different customers targeting mobility applications and as previously mentioned, we also received a new customer order in early fourth quarter for test and inspection of automotive power and management devices. Both PANTHER and Solstice will be major components of our market share expansion strategy as they address key test requirements aligned with technology trends in advanced packaging for integrated semiconductors. Last year, we also announced a new vision inspection module for enhanced micro-crack detection on wafer-level chip scale packages called Aquilae."
1,"Peter Kirlin, Chief Executive Officer; John Jordan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Christopher Progler, Vice President, Chief Technology Officer and Strategic Planning. The press release were issued earlier this morning, along with the presentation material, which accompanies our remarks are available on the Investor Relations section of our web page."
1,Phil will discuss some of the highlights from our fourth quarter results. I'll wrap with a reminder of our key strategic priorities for the year. 2017 was another strong year for our business with outstanding underwriting results and continued strength in portfolio quality.
1,"plan asset portfolio and investment strategy to more closely align with our peer group. When our investment strategy was defined prior to the company separation, we had a complex and defensive portfolio which hasn't provided the returns expected. By the first quarter of 2018, we will have unwound that strategy and also changed the number of asset managers."
1,"Please let me remind you that Q1 is for our continuing business, by far, our smallest quarter of the year, and that we generated in fiscal 2017 only 16% of our annual EBITDA in the first quarter. Turning to slide 7, we have made major progress in our key strategic initiatives. The U."

We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements."
1,"Please refer to the Non-IFRS Measures section of the financial review for more information. On the agenda today are fourth quarter and year-end financial results, the 2017 financial performance and operating review, a follow-up on our five-year strategic plan, as well as our objectives and projected financial performance for 2018. Our speakers today will be Mr."
1,"Please turn to slide 10 where we are providing more details on our consolidated restructuring plan. While we are working through the various constraints on our revenue level, we made the decision to optimize our cost structure across the company in support of our long-term strategy. On January 12, we adopted a consolidated restructuring plan that impacted three of our manufacturing facilities which we announced on January 19."
1,"Please turn to slide 15. Following on the success of our Strengthen, Diversify and Grow strategic initiative, Modine is now a more profitable, diversified industrial company. At the same time, we have reorganized the regional vehicular business segments into one global business unit, enabling a more structured approach to optimize our portfolio across our served markets."
1,"Please turn to slide number 6 for comments on our outlook. Our strategic priorities stay unchanged and they center around local anchoring, innovation, creating, and developing strong market positions in combination with operational efficiency and keeping financial and strategic flexibility. We will continue to focus on developing strong brands and securing a customer offering that is best in class."
1,"Products segment adjusted ESG&A expenses increased by approximately $2 million this year due to higher employee compensation costs, higher commissions expense and increased sales volume, and higher costs associated with the ERP system upgrade, as well as investments to grow our commercial offerings. The balance sheet continues to be strong to support our strategic priorities moving forward. Net debt at the end of the second fiscal quarter was approximately $285 million, which is $23 million lower than last year."
1,"Project CONNECT includes initiatives that drive revenue, capture cost of sales efficiencies through design and assortment optimization, generate SG&A savings and improve our marketing effectiveness. As these improvements begin to be realized, we intend to reallocate resources to our strategic priorities. Our 2018 financial outlook contemplates modest financial benefits from these initiatives while we anticipate more meaningful financial value capture in 2019."
1,"Projects include digital intake forms, mobile apps for check-in and wait time estimates, and a general software upgrade to our proprietary software platform to enable scale and enhance functionality, stability and security. Turning to slide 17, overall, we continue to execute on our long-term vision, which is to be the premier provider of chiropractic care in wellness and health plans; to accelerate our footprint through corporate and franchise strategy; to be career path of choice for chiropractors; to build a world-class organizational culture; to foster a robust Regional Developer community; and to build and maintain a world-class IT platform. Over the past year, we've made significant progress toward addressing the key challenges that face this company; rebuilding our franchise development strategy; improving our corporate clinic performance; increasing our new patient counts; stabilizing and improving the security of our IT platform; preserving cash; obtaining non-dilutive financing to strengthen our balance sheet; achieving company-wide adjusted EBITDA profitability; and increasing shareholder value."
1,"Put that together and we're anticipating lower to mid-single digit organic market growth for our end markets and products in 2018. We'll seek to outperform that organic market growth expectation by executing on our own strategic initiatives and to capture additional growth by completing further acquisitions. As for the trade case, in 2017, we demonstrated we could meet customer needs despite the significant disruptions and suffered no significant loss of customers or market share."
1,"Question number five is when will you up-list to the NASDAQ? Well, that is certainly our long-term plan to up-list to the NASDAQ Exchange. We're going to do it at the right time and when we meet the requirements to up-list to the NASDAQ listing."
1,"Question one is on IVR, data that we saw early in the year was very compelling, maybe you can give us a little bit more color on terms of the next development plan, and when we should be able to see maybe full color, when you recorded top line results? And then the second question is, if you can comment to the extent that you can on some of the strategic plans that you are discussing and what sort of strategic plans you have in mind and that would be great? Thank you."
1,"R&D in the quarter came in at the highest level in 2017 as our sodium oxybate trial continued to build momentum, and we incurred some Noctiva-related R&D costs. Following the recent successful issuance of our exchangeable notes, which you heard Mike say we netted about $137 million, we are now well-capitalized to fully execute our strategic priorities, including the full-scale commercial launch of Noctiva, completing the Phase 3 clinical trial of FT218, and continuing to explore strategically aligned and accretive acquisition opportunities. Despite the significant fourth quarter Noctiva investments, we were cash flow positive in 2017."
1,"Reaching the $1 billion adjusted EBITDA milestone will be an exciting accomplishment for EnLink. EnLink's 2018 strategic plan is driven by strong business fundamentals, a clear path forward with our seven growth strategies and the right team in place to continue to execute with excellence each and every day. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."
1,"Really taking businesses that have a lot of continued growth potential and white space out there and figuring out, how to grow and all of that, that comes along with it. Anything with regard to organizational infrastructure, strategic planning, account targeting, commercial activities, all of those things are areas that I'm anxious to really get my arms around. But again, in week three, still really learning, where kind of that low-hanging fruit is, but that'll be a part of the early process that we get into."
1,"RediClinic continues to be an attractive asset that can deliver low-cost care in a retail setting while giving us the opportunity to form partnerships with health systems and health plans to drive additional traffic to our stores. As we continue refining our strategy, these are the areas that represent our biggest strengths as well as our most significant opportunities. To execute this strategy, we must commit to growing as leaders and driving functional excellence throughout all levels of our organization."
1,"Refinanced our debt portfolio to extend maturities, increase flexibility and increase long-term fixed rate debt to add attractive interest rates, completed our third two for one stock split and increased the cash dividend by approximately 6%. As a result of these strategic initiatives and the contributions of Silgan's employees around the globe, our adjusted earnings per share were up 33% in the fourth quarter, 20% for the full year and free cash flow was up 25% versus 2016. Each of our operating businesses improved solidly over the prior year for the quarter and the full year."
1,"Regarding Global Fashion Group, now that Christoph will join as co-CEO and with you, Georgi, on the board, what will   we have, of course, talked about the profitability trajectory here. And what will be the key strategic priorities for you?"
1,"Repair revenue was down for a second consecutive quarter and margins tightened. I'd like to update you on the progress we made on our ongoing strategic initiatives during the quarter. We named two new business group presidents, kept advancing our productivity and cost savings efforts, made good progress on our systems refresh, took more steps towards achieving a zero harm safety culture and sold one of the two remaining retail store properties."
1,"results, our benefit ratio was in line with guidance, and our expense ratio, while elevated in the quarter, came in favorable as compared to the 2016 quarter. This is somewhat consistent with past years and reflects progress on certain strategic initiatives throughout 2017. Overall, our profit margin in the quarter improved over last year, driven by revenue growth of 2% on relatively flat expenses."
1,Retirement planning is a societal challenge and we're further supporting our employees with this expanded benefit. Tax reform supports investments towards our purpose and our long-term growth strategy. The return on investments that we've made in past years in the U.
1,"Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was a record $140 million, which represents an approximately 14% increase from the same quarter last year. This increase reflects the continued successful execution of our strategic initiatives and continued strong global semiconductor industry demand that we have seen over the last seven quarters. Drilling into revenue by product area, tungsten slurries accounted for 45% of total quarterly revenue."
1,Richard addressed that we have made select structural and personnel changes within parts of the organization that we inherited through the NorthStar merger and which have underperformed and we are confident that we now have the right teams in place to deliver the desired results. Being an outsourced passive owner of real estate is not a solution nor is it our long-term plan. We will take control positions and apply an investment management model to all of our balance sheet-heavy real estate businesses and our balance sheet-light total return strategies to accelerate our growth and improve our financial performance.
1,"Right. So we still are integrating three large companies and we still have this year to go in our integration strategy and we've added some things to that that we didn't really think we'd do this year. Like for instance, we're going to win gig in all 50 million passings that we serve and we're launching mobility this year."
1,"Right. The company seems to be much further along in its progress against all the big strategic initiatives than it was two years ago when you took on $12. 5 million of debt and did the tender offer, and I'm wondering if you think that the company is perhaps even overcapitalized today."
1,"Rob will provide more details on our updated outlook later on the call. This strong execution by our commercial and supply chain teams is a continuation of the performance these teams have been delivering for a number of years and has built a solid foundation for driving our strategic plan as an independent company. Last month, we reviewed our strategic plan with our board of directors and we are fully aligned with the planned strategic priorities."
1,"Rob, what's your go-to-market strategy here? Is it still direct or indirect?"
1,"Roughly 43% of our AMs have been with CDW for more than five years, more than a quarter have been with CDW for 10 years and we find   obviously, when we have tenured sales people we have tenured customer relationships, so the average customer relationship is 11 years. Taking a closer look then at our technical organization, every three years or so we go through a strategic planning exercise where we look at the competitive landscape, look at what's important to customers, assess how CDW is doing, look at the competitive set. And in 2010 is really when we made the decision to get much bigger in solutions and really double down on our technical capabilities."
1,"S. , and it's definitely something that we are actively working on, and it's part of our long-term strategy. But we believe both can work together, the directionality, the span, there's a lot yet to be discovered."
1,"S. , our team continued to execute on our strategic plan to drive growth for our top 500 SKUs, driven by the top 11 brands in both measured and non-measured channels. During the second quarter, we made progress in key areas of our business, a few of which I'll highlight today."
1,"S. , we continue to execute on our strategic plan to drive growth of our top 11 brands and top 500 SKUs. We have made significant brand-building investments and identified numerous opportunities to drive improved growth and profitability."
1,"S. are doing, we wanted to make sure that we stayed true to our strategy. So, if we think about how we invest some of those tailwind, and by the way, overall tax reform, I think for this country, for Eastman is fantastic to improve our competitiveness in the world."
1,"S. As you can see on slide 18, we believe that the data from INS-212 supports our filing strategy in this market. We have previously met with the Japanese regulatory authority to share our design prior to initiation and had received specific feedback from that agency for adjustments to the study, which we made, including a minimum number of Japanese patients which we exceeded."
1,"S. I was wondering what was the reason for adjusting your leverage targets given there is no change to your expectations of strategy. In France, I was wondering when you would be ready with the new pricing structure to better monetize content as Patrick Drahi said on the last call?"
1,"S. market and to expand our customer base, the recall of our LIO product and its impact on our business and results, the development of our sales and marketing organization, including higher and clinical specialists and the expansion of our sales team in Germany, our manufacturing plans including outsourcing plans, the markets in which we operate including our plans to obtain regulatory clearance in China for the G6, product development and intellectual property related matters, including those related to next generation platforms, clinical study plans, future operating expenses, changes in personnel, our strategic plans and our guidance for 2018, including overall and product line reviews and G6 system and probe shipment levels should be deemed to be forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are based upon our current estimates and various assumptions."
1,"S. market continues to perform in line with our expectations and in line with our forward-looking strategic plan targets. Note that despite the August and September hurricanes that affected certain areas in the South and Southeastern United States, fourth quarter domestic unit growth remains strong."
1,S. market's obviously quite different to Australia and what your strategy is in terms of I guess going into a much larger and more competitive market over there?
1,"S. securities laws, including guidance about expected future results, expectations regarding our ability to gain market share, and expected benefits from our investment and strategic plans. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements."
1,"S. So even if driverless car technology was readily available and mature and being sold into the market, again it would have virtually no influence on our market opportunity over our strategic planning horizon of five years or more. Now, the reality is, I think it's going to take a lot longer than five years even for that technology to get to the point where one can consider even to be sellable."
1,"S. We had, as two of the major components of the Granite's expansion and strategic plans, to grow into the water infrastructure, which obviously Layne is allowing us to do that in a big way now. But we've also mentioned that we want to move our vertically-integrated on our materials business to the East."
1,"Sales cycle in a nutshell has   there's no major change, if I were to pick to slight trend, I would say they're becoming crisper, and then more senior level dialog. So these are strategic plan driven   driven through a sales process, the more the landscape plays out to a smaller number of vendors, the less you need to do workshops and evaluating with multiple vendors. And therefore, there's a Temenos controlled element that we're getting better references."
1,"Sales in North America around 14% of total Frutarom sales compared with 8% in 2010, and no doubt we will do more acquisition in North America. To sum up, we are very happy with the results of the fourth quarter and 2017, representing a successful implementation of our growth strategy, another milestone in our journey. We are very optimistic about 2018, that will no doubt will be another record year for Frutarom, supported by fast internal growth, supported by our position in natural product, unique in solutions that we offer more than 70,000 products, as mentioned, more than 75% of them are natural products, tailor-made solution supported by 1,200 salespeople in 160 countries, 35,000 customers, 12,000 of them were added in the last five years and lot of cross-selling opportunities."
1,Sales network in all countries will have pressure all year to get us close to these goals as possible. The new strategic plan will be analyzed during the second part of this year and it will be launched for the next three-year period. We will continue working on the same lines trying to get the most profitable business instead only to talk about growth.
1,"Same thing when you think about our non-construction diversification what we realized our   probably our two verticals are power and hospitality, maybe it's a hospitality contractor or maybe it's an industrial contractor. There is usually a rent driven opportunities that we're going after and when we start to win with those projects, we often find ourselves where we've won at a very high level, but we have all of these underpenetrated sites that our local sales territory experts can go after and that leads to that continued expansion   we have a license to hunt and then we're able to really penetrate those sites on an ongoing basis, and so we've seen some gains with that more to come with our non-construction strategy. If you think about MM Connect."
1,"Sean Menke took over as CEO about a year ago and Sabre has kind of been really focused on   you've restructured your business in probably in a number of ways. Maybe Rick, can you kind summarize your top strategic priorities for the company at this point. And how that's   have changed or evolved from a year ago?"
1,"Second is to prudently deploy our available capital into first lien senior secured loans that meet our strict underwriting criteria in order to grow our net investment income. Third is to leverage our strategic initiatives to enhance SUNS' weighted average yield. Fourth, to continue to seek investment opportunities that expand our specialty finance capabilities in senior secured lending hedges that are less competitive offer attractive risk adjusted returns, and have a low correlation to the liquid leverage loan market."
1,"Second question, you've made a disclosure that you will make equity investments into NAVER Webtoon and in WAV Media. What is your long-term plan that you have by making investment into these contents, are you planning to mount the WAV Media contents through your streaming services, what is your long-term strategy here?"
1,"Second, it is important to note that of the four material awards announced in the quarter, each of our three geographical areas contributed meaningfully to the success across a mix of quality customers further demonstrating our ability to be globally competitive. Turning to the full year, we're focused on delivering on our strategic priorities for the year and made progress against each, including the following. One, to grow our leadership position in the Middle East; two, to focus on national oil companies and markets where capital is being invested while positioning ourselves for returning markets and anticipated upturn; three, to build upon strengthened customer alignment and relationships with a new technology focus; four, to deepen integration to build efficiencies and further enhance capabilities; and finally, to execute schedule and cost management with a continued focus on liquidity."
1,"Second, the closing of the Irish Stock Exchange acquisition is expected in March 2018 and the Irish Stock Exchange integration within Euronext will take place immediately thereafter. Third, we continued our acquisition strategy at the beginning of the year with the acquisition of InsiderLog, a Swedish company specializing insider list management for â‚¬5. 8 million to enhance further our Corporate Services offering."
1,"Second, this growth was accompanied by a major improvement of the group's economic results and its financial structure. 2017 was also a year of important successes in the deployment of our strategic plan Trust Together, particularly in terms of partnerships. Firstly, with the project of creating a single global joint venture between Air France-KLM, Delta and Virgin Atlantic; and secondly, with the intensification of the partnership with China Eastern."
1,"Second, we announced a refocused and disciplined corporate strategy based on a comprehensive review of our business, and we established financial ambitions to deliver long-term shareholder value. We also aligned the organization with our strategy through a restructuring program that will generate approximately $250 million in annualized savings by 2019. Third, we drove business growth through strong execution."
1,"Second, we are managing our cost to remain profitable as we invest in these growth initiatives with operating leverage to come from revenue growth, new value-added services and higher utilization of our data centers. Third, we're looking at a number of strategic initiatives to unlock value from our assets, which we believe provide us with a unique competitive advantage. This includes our national communications network and five data centers, approximately 3,400 business customers, and our 24 gigahertz and 38 gigahertz wireless spectrum licenses."
1,"Second, we expect a less inflationary environment in 2018 as we begin to lap 2017 inflation. Third, we've largely completed the necessary infrastructure investments to complete execution of our strategy in 2018, so these investments should become less of a headwind versus 2017. And lastly, we're focused on growing our services mix in these markets which should enhance future margins."
1,"Secondly, for existing shareholders, we are putting the work to cash we've generated on our balance sheet. We have sufficient liquidity with remaining cash in our revolver post-closing that we can continue to execute our strategy. And instead of leaving cash sitting idle, we have put it to work buying this immediate production and the long-term potential."
1,"Secondly, they come piece-by-piece, as a matter of fact, it goes over the whole year and concerning gross margin, there's no concern on that. And also, what we invest is really covered by long-term plans. We just accelerate plans we had before."
1,Shaping 2030 and the transformation towards one company will trigger a new era within the organization. Let's move to slide 9 and an update on our new strategy. What have we achieved so far and what are the next steps.
1,"Sheryl, you spoke about the strategic initiatives to both grow organically and inorganic and talked about leveraging scale and with 38,000, I believe you said, lots in total under control. When you think about what we've seen in the industry is really that same strategy to build scale, what's your appetite and what do you think the industry's appetite is right now for further consolidation, post Lennar/CalAtlantic deal and do you think there's likely for continued public-to-public M&A or would you say that your inorganic is going to be more geared to smaller sort of bolt-on acquisitions?"
1,"Similar to Film business, we are working towards improving the product mix for the business, while focusing more on high margin products. To conclude, I would like to reiterate that a collection of factors that include successful innovation, strategic initiatives towards improving product mix and driving down cost along with improving sector fundamentals will we believe help us deliver better performance going forward. That concludes my opening remarks."
1,"Simpler story, we think the market is growing a bit faster, and we want to place 20,000 Catalyst in international markets over 5 years. This is going back to our objectives that we shared last summer, and we placed nearly 4,000 last year in international markets. We're right on track with that growth, delivered 14% CAG recurring growth."
1,"Since 2013, we have deployed nearly $300 million in product acquisitions, designed to help build our current portfolio of commercial and pipeline products. At the end of last year, we continue to execute the strategic plan to grow our commercial portfolio by acquiring the NDAs and U. S."
1,"Since the acquisition of Wellcentive in 2016, we have been building and expanding our Population Health Management business. Our strategy comprises of a three-pronged approach. First, we help our customers to understand the needs of their population from a clinical, i."
1,"Since there's more people flock into these growing metro areas, more tenants will want to rent space in the increasingly scarce location, where we own properties. This focus goes hand-in-hand with the improvement of our properties and the sale of non-core assets, as well as investment in other properties that are compatible with our strategy. The focus on e-commerce and changes in consumer habits continue to affect the retail world and we believe the properties we own are highly resilient to these factors and indeed actually stand to benefit from them as omni-channel distribution becomes the prevailing strategy for retailers."
1,"Sir, does it mean you will reevaluate your Glucose strategy, you're doing that study and definitely GST will help?"
1,"Slide 14 best illustrates the resilience of our business model. During periods of unfavorable weather, we rely on our ability to flex operational and financial levers to meet our objectives. 2017 was no different as we experienced mild temperatures and heavy storm activity throughout most of the year and our team responded with cost performance and sound financial planning to deliver the consistent and predictable results you expect."
1,"Slide 14 provides a perspective of where we've been over the last couple of years, what we plan to accomplish this year, and how this positions us for next year. In 2016, we laid the groundwork for our future success by introducing our enterprise strategy and acquired two businesses, Magnum Gaskets and the forging operations from SIFCO in Brazil. Last year, we completed and integrated the Brevini and USM acquisitions, while profitably managing over $1 billion in revenues expansion and secured a sales backlog of $750 million."
1,"Slide 4 shows the fourth quarter and full-year highlights, excluding the impacts of tax reform. And I'm pleased to say that we continue to achieve record results through the successful execution of our strategic plan. Net income for the fourth quarter was $486 million, up 17% from the prior year, and earnings per share increased 19% to $1."
1,"Slide 7 is my new favorite. If anything speaks to A&B's knowledge of the Hawaii market, our expertise in identifying and executing high-quality transactions, our ability to develop the strategy and deliver on it, this is it. When we set out in 2013 to migrate our portfolio from the U."
1,"So   and that takes time to build out the infrastructure to do that. We're only part way through that and we've got more in front of us than we've accomplished so far, so it's just part of our long-term plans and that   the rate at which we move varies by country. Just to do with the scale of the country and the readiness of that country to progress."
1,"So   and that's not going to affect our business growth. Fourthly, there are certain strategic initiatives that are in the pipeline, as I earlier stated because of the regulatory requirements, it may not be appropriate for us to share those details with you now. Shortly, we would be sharing those details at the appropriate time with you."
1,"So a couple questions. First off, with respect to the investment plan or the strategic plan you laid out on the call, how should we think about, as we go through 2018, the cadence of investments along those lines and the potential benefits in terms of sales and other metrics? How should those line up?"
1,"So a split between NOR and NAND. The NAND piece of it is really consistent with our Flash strategy that we talked about before we're at the very high end of 3D NAND, these are high layer count devices, probably not even in full scale production yet, where customers really need FormFactor's high density MEMS technology to test these devices. Whether that becomes an industry-wide trend or not, we're not really in a position to speculate on at this point."
1,"So again, our view is about 3 times gross leverage is the right permanent fixture on our balance sheet. And then, once we get there, we return back to what our previous capital allocation strategy was, which was a combination of strategic value-enhancing M&A, which more likely in that means smaller to mid-size type acquisitions or in absence of that, return of capital to shareholders through our buyback programs. And so, once we get back down to those rough levels of around 3 times gross, we'll then revert back to our stated, tried and true capital allocation strategy around M&A and return of capital through buybacks."
1,"So any RASK outlook or of the performance has to be taken in conjunction with these two forces. Given that, we're going to   our strategy is essentially to ensure that we stay competitive. And if we have to take a load factor bias, we capitalize on the growing Indian market and make sure that we've been very selective in applying the right yield points, wherever we can in growing our overall RASK."
1,"So Arthur, first just for context, we're coming off a record quarter for dielectrics last quarter and we still saw a year-over-year growth. So quarter-to-quarter there's going to be some volatility, but we're really excited about just the execution of our strategy. And just to remind, we're really trying to transform that portfolio."
1,"So as you look at those areas, we feel we're well-positioned. We really saw this as an opportunity to continue to accelerate strategic initiatives in high return projects. So in addition, as you look at how we're breaking that down this year, in addition to investing in 2,000 real estate projects, both the high return new stores as well as the remodels with additional cooler capacity which is driving great sales benefits and the supporting infrastructure, we see an ability to accelerate the strategic initiatives, Todd mentioned digital and non-consumables to mention two of them, and other high return projects like EAS, which is helping us so much with shrink, expanding our private fleet to help mitigate risks around transportation costs and LED lighting which helps us save utility costs."
1,"So back to long-term, I'm going to wrap up with my prepared comments by talking about our long-term outlook. During 2017, we completed our first strategic plan as an integrated company. Now, with the benefit of Faiveley's worldwide transit presence to go along with our strong worldwide market position in freight and growing demand for PTC and signaling, this five-year plan meets our long-term financial goals to average double-digit growth in revenues and earnings through the business cycle with improving margins."
1,"So being two-and-a-half months in the job, what are my priorities? First of all, 2018 is the last year of our current strategic plan and we're focused on executing that plan with excellence. Over the past few years given our starting point and the tough market environment, we have rightly focused on expanding margin and driving the bottom line."
1,"So can you throw some light means what has means   this problem has been known to us for a very long period of time, why and how are we comfortable that now we will be able to increase the speed of launches and more launches will be there in these four markets. And yeah, also your strategy in these four markets and how is the market evolving in these four markets?"
1,"So concerning the new discovery of natural gas in the Bohai Bay Area, this is a very exciting and encouraging discovery, because it can facilitate our plan to increase natural gas production volume. So all along, our strategy and policy has been one to stabilize production volume in relation to oil and increase volume for gas. In this way, we can improve and optimize our product structure."
1,"So corporate development has been really productive for us over the past few years. So I think, as we said on our most recent conference call, we've deployed over $4 billion in capital over a few years in a number of transactions that we think have been consistent with our strategy, products that meet a compelling unmet medical need that are highly differentiated, high margin, promoted to a specialty audience meaning we can use a focused sales force that have good longevity that have the potential to expand other indications, other geographies. In some cases, other formulations."
1,"So far, 2018 activity has been on a similar pace to 2017 and I don't see any signs of it slowing down. Our activity levels and execution in 2017 and year-to-date 2018 support our key strategic initiatives, including, number one, to invest in our businesses, investing in attractive projects that leverage our existing infrastructure and further strengthen our competitive advantage. Number two, to proactively finance our growth program underway and to maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility."
1,"So first of all, the guidance that we've given in terms of making sure we get the double-digit growth in terms of medium term. If you look at our strategic priorities, our entire focus of Popular brands which is a fraction of the brands that we own is about investing in those brands, making them stronger and ensuring that the more premium brands grow faster than the ones below. So we expect that each segment of the market, if you try segment the market, that each segment will grow faster than the segment below it, right, and that's how premiumization is happening."
1,"So for today's call, to begin the discussion, I'll turn your attention to slide 3. 2017 was an extraordinary year for Amicus and we achieved four key strategic priorities across our two lead programs in Fabry and Pompe. First, we exceeded our Galafold launch targets with $36."
1,"So given that you have already done a deal with Novartis and it appears many more companies want to enter the gene therapy space, we have seen a deal land this morning. So I was wondering going forward, what's your strategy or your plan for your other pipeline products beyond LUXTURNA? Thank you."
1,"So hopefully, after hearing from Stewart, Sally and Justin, you can understand why I'm so excited to be leading Tyson Foods, and the future is bright. Our strategy is clear and that's to sustainably feed the world with the fastest growing protein brands. We do that by growing with differentiated capabilities, delivering on our cost commitments through continuous improvement and sustaining our company and our world for future generations."
1,"So hopefully, the message received back in December and released in the beginning of January are fairly consistent which is, overall, a fairly robust demand backdrop that we see our opportunity to rise up and deliver on our global platform. If you look at, I would think kind of our top priorities or strategic initiatives, similar to some of Bill's and mine and our other team members comments from about a month ago, first and foremost, it's about deepening our connections to our customers. Some of our customers are actually in the room right now."
1,"So how do we stable cash flows from TransAlta has been really, really important as we've gone through these last couple of years with low commodity prices. So, we continue to believe that both vehicles together work and that continues to be our strategy."
1,"So I don't really see that as something that we're going to be pursuing. There are interesting acquisition opportunities here and there, that we look at that would be part of our strategic plan that we could use the excess capital for. But the most obvious utilization of that excess capital will either be for the institution of a dividend, which we haven't decided upon, but we are actively discussing or continued share repurchases."
1,"So I think   so first of all, there's a little   there is some excess in that bucket for things like that, absolutely. And if you kind of the timing of when you would actually make any cash payment, provided you made announcements even quickly, we just look at it as, listen our big strategic initiatives, as Rich mentioned aren't in there as we normally model. However, there is a little bit of room in that bucket, and that might suffice, it depends, on the timing of any proposed footprint action."
1,"So I think there is still some period that we drive this strategy forward. In the long run, revenue will ultimately need to be a balance of price and volume, but certainly for now, we can use a lot of mileage in our small packages strategy. The system, the bottling system has a lot of advantages around the world."
1,So I think we're taking huge steps forward and I believe that the growth is coming. Our innovation strategy is working. We are delivering two quarters in a row about 13% return on capital employed.
1,"So I think we've demonstrated in a couple instances here the discipline we're applying and the way we grow. I think you've got a sense for our acquisition strategy or decisioning strategy. We want the returns on those investments to exceed the return on the buyback program, plus the risk premium."
1,So I think what I would like to do is just anchor you in the results again. And the strong results for the first quarter for our bank and they're really a reflection of our focus on the strategic priorities that we laid out for you at Investor Day in December. And to remind you of what are the key areas of focus for us as a leadership team.
1,"So if that can be done, then like I think that large part of our issue will be solved and then obviously we have other markets like the Middle East and other parts where the balance million can go if that be the need. So, a long-term plan is being worked out, hopefully in the next about six months to eight months we will be able to breakthrough with both these countries on a long-term trade for sugar."
1,"So if you don't have those postpaid customers, of course, you don't get that opportunity for migration. So that is also part of our strategy here. And also allowed us to address the affordability segment in the marketplace with a rate plan of $20 to make sure we're serving all segments of the market in Canada and allowing us to address some of the government concerns recently to make sure that our service provided price points across all possible price points in the market addressing all segments."
1,"So I'm excited about it. And I think that's one of the things as we go forward in our strategic plan that we'll give more color on, on the next call is that we want to not only dramatically improve our bottom line, but we also want to increase our investments in some of these innovation areas. As it relates to go-to-market, we feel like we're pretty innovative in terms of the way we're going to market but we feel like there is things that we could bring to the marketplace that we haven't done to-date."
1,"So in a way   also do you think our competition level will continue to rise for the New Year and also what's your target revenue mix for key accounts in 2018? Now my second question is, what's your most recent strategy to support your franchisees and any measures that you are planning to take in 2018? So   and where you are increasing your subsidies provided to those franchisees with weaker profitability?"
1,"So in terms of tax, unlike a lot of companies that are sitting on piles of cash overseas and they're looking for something to do with it in the next several months, our situation's a little different in that we've already heavily invested the cash that we generated overseas into things like our breweries in Mexico as well as our Canopy investment in Canada. And so for us, I think the cash flow benefits that we think accrue over time get deployed along the lines of the rest of our previously stated capital allocation strategy, which is continue to invest in the business, return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And occasionally where we can get a growth accretive and ROIC accretive sort of M&A transaction, we'll look at that as well."
1,"So it was a  of the year and to conclude the acquisition question, we were very happy on this  there for a   since a few years. Obviously, the acquisition of Alterra fits very well into that strategic plan. As we have explained in the past, we were focusing on going out of   not going out, but going outside Canada in order to grow our footprint and grow out portfolio, so that was part of the plan; was going also in the U."
1,So it was a very strong growth year. We achieved our objectives of 10% organic growth. We exceeded that and our normalized comparable constant currency EPS growth was 21%.
1,"So it's imperative that we reset our cost structure to be more effective in today's marketplace. At the same time, we must ensure our organization and infrastructure have the right capabilities and scale to drive our strategic plan initiatives for longer-term growth and consistency. To achieve this, we must approach our costs in a thorough, methodical, and effective way while balancing the need for speed and impact."
1,"So maybe, Ron, with that as a starting point, there's a new management team in place at Perrigo. Obviously, you've been at the company much longer in terms of Uwe, sort of he's relatively fresh in the job but he's been there for a couple of months now, maybe outline some of the strategic priorities for the business in the near-term? Obviously, Uwe is ongoing a strategic review and sort of going to outline some things down the road, but maybe it'd be helpful to understand some of the things that he's looking at and what are the priorities there?"
1,"So on the manufacturing side, Fluid Handling comes with seven factories and four systems integration shops, 95% of the hours are in high-cost parts of the world. Our strategy around consolidation of manufacturing, shifting the center of gravity to low cost, thinking differently about what we make versus buy, is very much applicable to Fluid Handling, so lot of opportunity here to reduce cost and have a much more effective supply base and supply chain overall. The other thing that's worth noting here is the Fluid Handling business tends to be a lot more vertically integrated than what we have at CIRCOR and what we've been doing at CIRCOR."
1,"So our overall strategy is, that we're not going to change the guidance we gave around gross and operating margins. We're clearly outperforming at the moment, because the rate of growth of business has seen you're seeing some of these product mix transitions benefit us with higher power lasers at 8 kilowatts, 10 kilowatts and 12 kilowatts, you saw very strong sales of the QCW lasers, you've seen a move even up in the pulsed lasers to higher power pulsed lasers."
1,"So overall, a reasonably challenging first six months for the business but we are seeing some green shoots and we are seeing the fundamentals of the business really give us confidence in the future growth of the sector. Now we're really confident that our strategy to focus on customer choice and to reposition the portfolio sets us up for continued growth in future years. Thanks and I'll ask Mark to wrap up for us."
1,"So that being the case, we don't see any problem in terms of inadequacy   of capital adequacy or because of that, the growth potential of the loan book of the PFS in the times to come. Or for that matter, if the PFS has any further strategic plan to embark upon, those will also not be restrained or curtailed."
1,"So that hasn't changed. And then on inventories we spelled out in our objectives, in our scorecard how we think about it. And our objective as I said earlier is to maintain high levels of customer service, minimize inventory obsolescence, improve manufacturing utilization."
1,"So that leads us to our growth strategies. And tied to those three areas, those three universal needs are our therapy innovation strategy and a program through which we continuously use technology to improve clinical outcomes very much in line with the mission that I talked about. Equally, to improve access, and although we're focused in every country even in developed markets, globalization and reaching the emerging markets, I think you'll agree, is the biggest opportunity for equalization of access."
1,"So that million dollar impact on our GP, again just related to buying and getting paid in euros mainly and having our operating costs and our supplier costs in Czech crowns. We've rethought how our sourcing strategy to more align the purchases we're making in Euros to align with the revenues we're receiving from our customers. So that's one which will be take care of a lot of that."
1,"So that, coupled with the record capital spending that we had within the year I think bodes well for our execution of the business plan. And then we entered 2018 with achieving the majority of our step increase which is one of our goals that we set a couple of years ago as we retooled our strategic plan. So the company has positioned itself very, very well."
1,"So that's kind of a new approach for us, some call that the hunter and farmer method, but at the end of the day, it's really about putting an emphasis on both the renewing customers and the new business that I think these very, very large markets have the opportunity to give us. We've really not only changed our go-to-market sales strategy, but our strategic plan talks about kind of the full market penetration with additional resourcing, resourcing around the strongest in growing categories, putting more so to speak gas on those fires to accelerate the strength in categories. And you're going to have category mix shifts across the business, but we have to support those categories where we see any softness or any weakness with additional marketing emphasis and primarily around the audience acquisition, not every attendee wants to see every exhibitor, but we have to be conscious of those attendees that want to see specific categories and better resources around the quality and quantity of attendees in any specific soft categories that we have."
1,"So that's part of what we've been able to focus on as well. So, the message from Owen to the team has been the large horsepower is at 92%, we're deploying growth capital to grow that, but to meet our objectives, we need to reactivate the underutilized fleet, and we're very cognizant of that."
1,"So that's what we call while it has elements of it that are more price sensitive as it relates to inflows of taxes and other portions of funding, there are also core operating relationships that come along with that and then the natural, what I call referral center of influence base from being the primary account for a number of these municipalities. So it remains an important part of our strategy and important part of our commitment to the community as well."
1,"So that's why we are charging ahead on being the primary bank and the bank of choice and building our own go-to platforms in financial services. And it has always been in our strategy that we have to make sure that we do two things. One thing is that we build our own platforms and that we build those platforms in a way that clients really, really, really love us."
1,"So the businesses are financially ready for independence with high-quality capital bases, well-positioned to fund future growth plans, meet the regulatory and debt obligations, and sustain future dividend paying capacity. Delivering on our strategy has been underpinned by the capital management policy that we introduced at the start of the managed separation in which we intend to remain in place until the delisting of Old Mutual plc shares. We are today declaring a second interim dividend for 2017 of Â£0."
1,"So the intention, we remain very committed in the healthcare sector. As I've said, often times when you adjust your strategy, you have to pivot a bit. And the sales cycle in terms of prospecting and conversion of a prospect to a client can take a little bit of time."
1,"So therefore, our cost as absolute number is an important number. We are maintaining discipline, but as we move into new horizon the next year   next   this year, we're going to come out with our next three-year strategic plan. And in that plan, depending on where we're going to go, depending on how ambitious we want to aim, there are many things that we would do that probably would require investment, and we will share with you when we are there."
1,"So these are all the possibilities where we feel there is a need. And we do present periodically to the board on the strategic initiatives and get their input and based on that, we'll be working in the coming New Year also."
1,"So this is a well thought out from our perspective strategy that we laid out a few years ago that's, again, as I'd mentioned before, going well according to plan. And we don't see a need to curtail any of the investment expectations that we have in order to meet our objectives."
1,"So this is not influencing any number in any material aspect. So, digital revenue   but having said that, just one additional remark, you know that one of the strategic initiatives on the M&A side is buying excellent market-leading technology and thus this is the rational for making the acquisition in Cumulocity and Zementis. And given the fact   and that leads to your first question also, given the fact that we are about setting up a third business line with the main contributors being those two products to see how relevant that is moving forward and how important it is and how successful we are in integrating acquired companies."
1,"So to me, this is   this year is about execution, we've got some big   hopefully ending the concerns on strategy and execution, hopefully it's more weighted there, execution versus the strategy. Because I think our strategy is pretty good. And so this year it's about execution."
1,"So Vince, just on the Gore royalty, this is sort of your first time having to pro forma Bard. Bard had talked about their strategic plans for how they were going to offset the Gore royalty. You've obviously moved that to other income which is the appropriate treatment."
1,"So we   and we have a five-year outlook, if you will. We got through our strategic planning process where we're constantly questioning our existing strategy and looking to see if there's other things that we should be doing to keep that   keep those opportunities in the pipeline. So yeah, I think it's going to be I guess I'd say all of the above kind of thing and we've got a strategic development team that's focused on looking at things outside the footprint, things that maybe a little bit different than what we're looking at in our existing businesses, but we're also looking for existing businesses to be creative and innovative as well."
1,"So we are feeling very good about that. And I would also remark that all that was done at a time where our flagship strategy really wasn't effectuated yet and we hadn't begun to see the audience improvements that we are now seeing. So, as we go into longer term renewals, which, again, there's no renewals on the near term horizon, we're also going to benefit from a stronger product line, which I think is key."
1,So we can't be very explicit because any comment I make could be misinterpreted. The idea once again is to talk about the new strategic plan at the end of February because by then hopefully we would have finished everything that has to do with the negotiations with the trade unions.
1,"So we expect to see it meaningfully better than that. We're not going to give specific guidance, but you should in general expect us to be able to mitigate most of the price erosion based on our price increase strategy."
1,"So we have a number of company veterans, as well as some new execs we met last week in Vancouver who'll join the business from outside LULU, who are already working hard to turn this into a strength of the company. You add data to the competitive advantages I took you through and the strategic initiatives in 2018 and beyond, and that's going to be really something that's going to ignite the performance of the business. Lastly, I'm pretty sure there's going to be a number of questions on the CEO search, and why don't I just get ahead of that."
1,"So we look   we kick the tires a lot. Particular things that are interesting to us, we articulate our strategic priorities as including the one probably that fits best with an acquisition strategy is growing outside the United States, growing our global footprint. We're still, despite the accelerated growth we've seen in the last couple of years outside the United States, it still represents only about 7% of our revenues."
1,"So we still are having ongoing conversations with the customers. And as I've mentioned before, I reiterate these are existing customers and these are some strategic initiatives that we're working through with them. And while I was hoping that we might have those finalized by now, I would still   I still feel like we will sometime this quarter."
1,"So we think it's really important to continue to do these investments. And with driving the productivity and the benefits that we're giving productivity, that gives us that much more capability to be able to invest in these strategic initiatives."
1,So we're acting swiftly to continue to deliver upon that newness for her. I will tell you that over the long term there's many strategic initiatives that we are looking at. We have seen certainly with our financing a very meaningful success and we believe that there's opportunity that will continue there.
1,"So we're going to estimate capital investments will be about CAD 80 million this year, CAD 40 million of it will be in discretionary maintenance and business investments, including capital roads, and about CAD 40 million will be in strategic capital investments. The strategic capital investments will include about CAD 10 million in business streamlining and consolidating and the balance will be focused on improving manufacturing of targeted products that support our strategy of moving up the value chain. Included in that, that balance will be upgrading Arlington."
1,"So we're not targeting any particular market. We're remaining diligent and disciplined as it relates to deal multiples, synergistic fit, strategic initiatives and thoughts as it relates to what we can do from an acquisition and combination perspective. So we're seeing it across all end markets and really excited about the pipeline today as far as where those acquisition candidates are coming from."
1,"So when we had launched our QIP in May 2017 as a part of our use of proceeds, we had said that we would end up spending anywhere between INR 50 crores to INR 75 crores on the rummy vertical. So that's our long-term plan and that's the kind of money that we would want to pump in over a period of time. Now, whether it'll happen in one year, whether it will happen in two years, or whether it happens in six months, it will depend on how the business is received and how the growth momentum picks up."
1,"So with our China factory being the largest advanced packaging factory in China, we're really well-positioned to offer that. And the second element that's really dovetailed from that is with the China fabless customers which are in the area that we have little market share with, that's been a very big strategic initiative for us to really grow our presence with the fabless customers. So when we look at the advanced technology market, we see ourselves in the mid double digits there and we think that our entitlement to that share has probably doubled that."
1,So you're very much on track with your long-term plan for the Medical division?
1,"So, apart from this contract being a good contract for the insurance business, we anticipate to see some synergies for our outpatient and pharma business, less for the hospitals, because this people by anyway were getting into our hospitals. So, we have continued to deliver on our key strategic priorities in what has been the significant year of transition and investments in the key hospital redevelopments. In addition, we have made good progress in the roll-out of polyclinics and completed very important pharma business integration, and GHG remains in a good shape to deliver its key 2018 targets and priorities."
1,"So, as I've said for quite a while now that we will continue to accelerate our internal pipeline and augment that with external bolt-on acquisitions and licensing deals. And your question is related to Monsanto and how that might impact our strategy. You know that we have extended our partnership with Ionis for the Factor XI, like a technology product."
1,"So, even before we went public, we ran mock earnings calls and tried to make sure we had predictability throughout the process and   so, I guess that rolls through the way we think about everything. In terms of strategic planning, we have a very long-term view. Our mission is to unleash the potential of every team."
1,"So, first off, in my prepared remarks I mentioned that after analyzing the reverse mortgage business, which generated for us $24 million in pre-tax profit last year, we've decided to continue operating the Reverse Lending business as a key strategic part of our go-forward strategy. And I don't have the capital allocation to that business on my fingertips."
1,"So, I feel very, very comfortable with the team I have. We're highly focused on the four Hubbell strategic initiatives and that's why we come to work every day. So, I appreciate the opportunity to be here today and certainly will take any questions that you might have."
1,"So, I think our competitors are largely spending more money on content and those guys are levered at three times and four times. We've got a different leverage profile, we've got a different size, so our strategy has to be different in order for us to be successful. So our strategy   in 2017, we ended up more in our content costs because we felt like, we could and we wanted to commit to EBITDA growth."
1,"So, I think that the tax benefit we've talked a lot internally what that means for us. I don't think it really will change fundamentally how we manage the company and what our plans are and how we execute upon our strategic initiatives. But it certainly provides additional flexibility and we're constantly looking for opportunities to begin to play offense in terms of growth initiatives."
1,"So, I think that we haven't missed a lot in terms of calculating the customer profitability and application that we have built with Oracle and in-house contribution. So we can now just identify the profitability of the customer, the profitability of the product, the profitability of distribution channels or touch points So, we will shape our branch strategy accordingly but what has happened is the size of the branches has shrinked. We used to have more than 20 employees per branch."
1,"So, in 2018, what we're seeing and what we gave guidance for when we gave that in October is that we see an increase in the activity levels across all of our business, tower, small cells and fiber solutions. And so, our strategic priorities will be to ensure that we can meet that demand for our customers over the time. And that means both integrating our recent acquisition including Lightower and providing the small cell implementation that we need to, to meet the record backlog and pipeline that we have, which is about 25,000 small cells that we need to build."
1,"So, in a way, there's a line of consolidation into that actually. And I think it maybe gives us even more energy to accelerate what we're doing because this is our strategy that we've talked to you about for some time, and we are in full execution of doing. So, I think it will be even more focused on the customers in this space and delivering excellence to our customers."
1,"So, in conclusion, I want to thank you all for your support in 2017, a year marked by political volatility and low levels of confidence in South Africa and compounded for Nedbank by the impact of ETI's Q4 2016 numbers. But also a year that we believe Nedbank made significant progress on our strategic priorities and delivered a solid performance, particularly from managed operations as we benefited from excellent credit risk management and tight expense control. As 2018 dawns under new political leadership in South Africa and renewed hope to address the economic challenges we face, I know that Nedbank is well-positioned to benefit from the improving macroeconomic environment, underpinned by continuation of the global growth story added to by cyclical upswing in South African growth and the real possibilities of structural reform in our economy."
1,"So, in conclusion, the second quarter was a very strong quarter. Financial results evidence the merits of our strategic plan and our execution against that plan. Customers are responding to and buying our offerings."
1,"So, in conclusion, what I hope that you've heard from me today and you've gotten a sense of is the role that Sabre Travel Network plays at the center of an unbelievably rich and complex ecosystem connecting buyers and sellers through our core competencies of retailing, distribution and fulfillment. Our strategic priorities to enrich our channels for suppliers is to deliver a consistent personalized brand experience and to ensure that our agency partners can fulfill and service those customers efficiently and effectively through their network. And finally, Travel Network has shown strong growth and has significant opportunities to grow the revenue pie across the ecosystem."
1,"So, in November, as we were closing in on the end of the year, we conducted a management and board retreat to set the course for the next five-year plan. The theme that emerged from this strategic plan was moving ahead as \\""One Insperity,\\"" leveraging our unique breadth, depth and level of care of our services across all our offerings to earn each customer for life. We will be forming teams around each of these key success factors for this plan, which are growth acceleration, operational excellence, technology leadership, risk optimization and talent development."
1,"So, Joe, we have worked very hard to document our plans and strategies in the form of very comprehensive and realistic strategic plan that's grounded the opportunities in our marketplace and the capabilities of our team. And we process opportunities, strategic and otherwise, as they come through the funnel of our plan and the priorities that we've identified, the goals and initiatives and priorities."
1,"So, just a little bit more color, Davis. So, on that strategy, just to make sure I'm clear, if the oil price theoretically went to $70, $75, that wouldn't necessarily change your hedging strategy which can be tied more to these kind of the debt levels. Is that correct?"
1,"So, just in terms of   there's a number of factors determining our approach and we're ready to take a very long-term view in terms of the sustainability and the addition to our overall platform. So, that's really the way we go analyzing the merits of targets in our acquisition strategy."
1,"So, just to summarize what we have covered this morning, during 2017, our positive financial performance continued and we made further strategic and operational progress. Going forward, key business trends in the early part of 2018 are consistent with 2017, and we're confident that by continuing to execute on our strategy, we will deliver another year of underlying growth in revenue and adjusted operating profit, together with growth in adjusted earnings per share on a constant-currency basis. And with that, I think we're ready to go to questions."
1,"So, kind of say, in conclusion before I hand back to Robert, we have again reduced a record result in line with guidance. This has been achieved against the backdrop of developing our key IT strategic initiatives which are being operationalized and from which the first fruits are now being enjoyed and with more to come as previously foreshadowed. Rob?"
1,"So, let me conclude our comments this morning. We're off to a great start with a strong first quarter and our team is successfully executing on our key strategic priorities. We continue to focus on generating durable and profitable growth while enhancing margins, optimizing our cost structure, and investing in value-creating growth opportunities."
1,"So, let me just address first that as we've indicated in the past, it's business as usual. We remain squarely focused on our three strategic priorities to win in the category and serve our customers and consumers better than anyone else. And that remains squarely our focus as an organization going forward."
1,"So, let's look at our strategy very briefly. Our strategy has two main components. Number one, and I won't spend much time on this, it's the user experience for our customers, how they interphase with their building, how they interphase with their service providers, how they get information."
1,"So, look, we're going to continue to be strategic in our focus around M&A. Obviously, anything we do from an M&A standpoint really needs to tie in to what our overall growth strategy is, not just for the sake of going and getting bigger or doing something. And so I take this back to what I laid out at Investor Day last year in terms of the three focus areas, one being obviously building out the smart infrastructure component, two was looking at the opportunities over time to expand our presence in the industrial part of the water sector."
1,"So, our target for the next years is clear revenue growth, margin improvement. And to achieve this, we will continue with our strategy of leadership in the businesses where we compete, investing in Innovation and technology and ensuring we always remain the trusted partner of our clients. Operational Excellence, maximizing synergies, optimizing back office are the key elements to improve margins and we are focused on it."
1,"So, that's a really main one that we're focused on this year. We did a gap analysis in 2017 on all of our digital type products, and we have a strategic plan over the next three years that we're using to close any gaps that remain in terms of our digital process or digital products. Some of those with the tax cut, we may accelerate and be able to do them a little bit faster."
1,"So, that's kind of in our cost structure right now and we will continue to go ahead and invest in technology, reusing and leveraging a lot of the investments we've already and building on top of those investments. So, a big part of our strategy is to migrate to one platform and invest in one platform, reuse innovations, and we think from a cost perspective and investment perspective, we're well served at a steady-state level."
1,"So, the combination of all of them put together really allows Granite and the Layne combination to be a leader in the water and wastewater market infrastructure. And that's been a key component of our strategic plan for the last two years. This is a huge step for allowing us to become one of the leaders in the country relative to the water infrastructure."
1,"So, the goal right now is to get that platform in a position where we can reaccelerate, actually accelerate beyond our prior speeds, the rate at which we add new products and add new fulfillers in new geographies. So, it definitely remains core to our medium-term growth strategy."
1,"So, the important thing is that we need to get these transactions done. We'll need to then, as usual, do our long-term plans, look at our cash flows. And when we come back in August, of course, we'll have a little bit more certainty around that, possibly not yet   not then on the sale."
1,"So, then only we will know exactly what sort of plantings have happened and after that what sort of rainfalls we have. That is why the Government of India, we're already working on a long-term plan where India will need to export or should have a plan in place for next year that we may have to export about 3 million tonnes to 4 million tonnes. That is why the 2 million tonnes that Bangladesh imports every year, we all want India to be the only supplier to that country because it's very, very close to us."
1,"So, these are, I mean, two separate initiatives, really exciting. We want to tell you about it because it fits our long-term strategic plan. So, we have a well-thought-out plan for the future."
1,"So, third quarter was a strong quarter, the team executed well. Our performance demonstrated the strength of our strategic plan and the value proposition that continues to support it. Both of our operating segments turned in solid results, as we generated record revenue of just over $40 million in the quarter, up 7."
1,"So, this is not about succession. What this is, is an opportunity for Neil, who's worked at Yeoman Way with everybody on our strategic planning process, where he and I had spent much more time together as we're developing what we're doing. So, I think we were like 78."
1,"So, those two things working together and some other changes that will be made over time, that I can't speak about at this moment, we'll be sharing with you as we go through the process throughout the year. But I would consider it in the evolution of our investment strategy."
1,"So, turn the page 8, if you will, and we'll go through our growth strategy. And our growth strategy really doesn't change from what it was before. Citizens Business Bank will continue to grow in three ways, same-store sales, which is all of our branches, we call them business financial centers."
1,"So, two-part answer for that. Our strategic initiative now in Healthcare is probably more compelling than it's ever been, because when we first did the HHA acquisition, it was all about the acute space, what do you do in the hospital? Through 2020 vision, we pulled some of our B&I kind of office expertise that was in medical facilities and put that in with HHA."
1,"So, we all think about both our business strategy and our market strategy working backwards from how do we enable our customers be successful, how do we enable them to redefine their customer experiences. And we look at what it means for a company to transform themselves digitally and to redefine their customer experience, it's not just the front-office, it's about unlocking the data from all of their systems to redefine that experience."
1,"So, we are still awaiting commercialization plans from Galderma. They have some internal strategic priorities, but we do know that they intend to launch. So, we are still awaiting."
1,"So, we get many ammunition, I would say, in order to still consider growth in terms of capital without considering other capital action, but having in mind that we have many other ammunition if needed to deploy. In terms of comments from ECB, you are   basically the first one   we have already just terminated our board, so this strategy has been now announced to the market and to ECB and so we will see and I expect that they having agreed last year to a reduction much less stronger than what we are giving now, I imagine they can be satisfied, we are going down â‚¬10 billion from what was agreed only one year ago and seven full points what was agreed only one year ago. So, let's   I don't want to talk for others, but I hope that they will be very satisfied."
1,"So, we had   as a percent, I don't have that. When I take a look at the goals that we had for each of the marketplaces, the areas that we had growth initiatives and we hit our objectives during the fourth quarter and for 2017, the areas that we expect to be growing, we are and   but I don't know the percentage. We can get that, but it's a larger percent than the rest of the company just because of the scale of the marketplace."
1,"So, we have a lot teed up and ready to go right now and we really don't see backing off of that. And let me just expand that a little bit into our strategy for funding those loans. We have a tremendous amount of short-term funding available to us, so funding the loans is not going to be a problem."
1,"So, we have made some investments in improving our capabilities in the investing area in solutions. We've been investing in technology, we're investing in also distribution, the changing distribution landscape and getting smart investing in technology and that   and new products and marketing, so it's kind of the list we've gone through in the past, all the strategic initiatives that we've gone through, there is no change to that, but I mean, do you want to add anything on the distribution side that we're investing in."
1,"So, we have seen proof points of the strategy, particularly the focus on the pillars, and let me just highlight a few for you, and needless to say and that's why this slide is called on track to deliver on our strategic commitments for the next three years, that we will continue to use the focus on these three pillars. I've actually been very pleased with the way the organization has responded to the let's say simplification of our strategy, and of course there is reason why people responded in a favorable way, and let me go into the very first one. We did share with you in November that, that we felt that we needed put a much stronger focus on our people."
1,"So, we haven't said but we really believe that with our buy-sell-swap strategy in place with TV. We think that that's sort of earmarked for that from a liquidity perspective to help with that strategy."
1,"So, we intend to continue this part of the strategy. Now, obviously, you will understand that I can hardly comment on what we have in our strategic plan for obvious reasons, neither can I comment on the potential targets that will help us to do those entries. Now, if you are asking me is industrial automation of great interest to Legrand, I would answer, no."
1,"So, we keep doing that. Our strategy is, I mean, consistent with what the regulator is asking, and it is normal. And the more we move towards a banking union, that balance sheet of banks are de-risked to reach the final pillar of the banking union, which is the European Deposit Insurance Scheme."
1,"So, we only have $400 million of   and most of that is going to the STAR project and upgrading our cokers at Garyville. We're taking our cokers at Garyville from a 30-foot diameter drum and we're going to replace those with a 32-foot diameter drum as part of our strategy to be able to take the resid out of the marketplace. At Speedway, we're going to invest $530 million."
1,"So, we remain confident that these are going to continue to improve, but the important thing to note is we've identified the challenges surrounding these. And when we look at our real estate strategy moving forward, we're keen not to kind of fall into the same trap that we did in F 2017."
1,"So, we're at a local district level, we probably   we look at it your way, but across the company, we're looking at it on a gross metric standpoint and then seeing where the biggest growth opportunity is as we look forward. We look very closely at each fall when we do strategic planning with our areas at what MSAs are growing. What's our GDP?"
1,"So, we're on a trajectory, so we're going to stay patient, the capital will come, it will come in the form of deployments, it will come in the form of shareholder returns. We like our position and the very strong capital, it produces a lot of flexibility for us in terms of our strategic initiatives, and I think we're still a capital return story just maybe a tiny bit longer than you would like us   than you would like us to be. So, that's how I describe it."
1,"So, we're really confident, Farha, that the RFS is going to continue in its present form at least through 2022 and even beyond that in a similar fashion that will be administered by   at the direction of EPA. But even if it were to be altered, our strategy has been geared toward operating top-tier plants that will compete even in the most difficult circumstances. We think ELEMENT will rank right at the top of that list."
1,"So, we've got the financial flexibility. We improved a number of the elements of the terms of our various debt instruments so that we can now execute our strategic plan and evolve the company through the cycles very effectively. We also, as I said, we pushed out the maturities and feel very good about those transactions."
1,"So, what is your view about that type of comment and how is the company going to deal with this type of view of the market? And the second question is that looking at the news reports related to your NTP strategy that you had announced today during the event, it seems that there is a lot of focus and a lot of mention about the platform expansion that the company wants to achieve. For example, the different IPs you want to take across not only console platforms, but PCs and also for Steam also."
1,"So, what we have said in our new strategic plan is that we want to strengthen our brands and one, only one of the things we want to do is to competitively spend behind what we call working media. So, yes, we will be spending more, but what is the source of this is basically two sources."
1,"So, what will we then deliver at the end, I hope a sustainable future, which will have these elements. And like in the case of Temenos, we continuously revise our strategy and keep up-to-date with trends. And these are elements which we believe are core."
1,"So, when I think about diversification both at a corporate level and then specific to my business, it's something that we've been working very hard at, and I think that's showing in the results. If I look at the EMS business as a whole, this business, I think, was kind of, from an operating margin perspective, in the 2s, just a couple of years ago, and I think there's been a sustainable range shift upward into the 3s that you saw in our fiscal 2017, and that's in large part due to the benefits of our diversification strategy that have taken play."
1,"So, when we are and we think we'll be of a scale towards the end of the year that this will become less and less of an issue. And certainly, once we hit our strategic plan, one target of getting over the billion-dollar hump, this issue will probably completely abate itself just because of scale."
1,"So, whilst the short-term outlook is challenging and there is much work to do on transformation, I believe the actions we are taking will provide a firm, prudent and necessary foundation upon which to improve the long-term performance of Capita. As we go through 2018, we will update the market more fully on our plans around cost, our planned disposals, our revised strategy, and the equity plans that we'll inform. We have the building blocks of Capita to create a great business, one that is more focused on a core set of markets that can deliver sustainable growth; one that is less complex, more accountable, and has operational discipline at its heart; one that generates sustainable free cash flow and a return for its shareholders."
1,"So, without this effect, we would be slightly positive. We could also see very promising trends in the areas of KB's strategic priorities. I will mention two of them, the orange color is from cross-selling, are going up by 12%, led by increases of volumes in mutual funds and life insurance."
1,"So, yes in fact we have been cutting the tail. Our strategy is to locate our largest most complex refineries around our three trading hubs and in those areas where they integrate with Chemicals, but there are few what we call choice refineries we also have, so just to give you a few examples. So, for   for example in the Philippines, that would be a tail refinery, our Tabangao Refinery."
1,"So, you can do the math there. So, let me   this is a little bit about how we do the bricks and the clicks and the digital story, which we can go through offline, if you want to, in a little bit more detail, but I'll just wrap it up here with   you look at the opportunity that we have already with the five biggest populations in the world and what we've put together with regard to our global growth strategy to provide more access, more engagement and more support will absolutely yield incremental sales growth for the future. So, thank you."
1,"So, you have immediate access to what was previously trapped OUS cash for Johnson & Johnson that was about $16 billion, and you have ongoing access to your global cash flows. How does that alter, if at all, your strategic planning? How does it alter how you think about the allocation of your capital as a company?"
1,"Software gross margin rate was down due to lower Software license revenue. The decrease from lower Software license revenue was partially offset by our continued execution on strategic priorities to improve efficiency and scale in our Software maintenance and cloud businesses. We expect margins for the Software segment to increase over time, as we see improved performance in cloud revenues and we continue to expand Software maintenance and cloud margins."
1,"Some of our investments do seem to be happening simultaneously and I appreciate the pressure on capital allocation that you are raising for us. So I'll clarify both in terms of strategy and our current treatment of capital allocation strategy as far as that is concerned. See our long-term opportunities that we've identified, we have identified men's casual wear, innerwear is a large segment simply because of the change in lifestyle that consumers are going through a more active healthy lifestyle which requires and you've seen in the men's side,."
1,"Some of that needs to continue to grow, but I think what the areas has been pushing us to do is to also get much higher productivity, much higher profitability out of these places. In fact, for the first time in the strategic plan a few months ago, we actually put together full P&L across all of these regions. We've put together dashboards for our sales and marketing, for our sales force effectiveness, for NPI vitality, a lot more operationally savvy work and really creating an organization which is at one with the rest of Honeywell versus, here is a High Growth Region organization and here's the rest of the businesses and think about them in terms of matrix, we're really actually operating a lot more at one."
1,"Sometimes, I think the large franchise distributors focus more on the larger customers within distribution. So, our strategy has been very clearly as we've gone around the globe to make sure that we have a good coverage, but be coverage for the smallest customers within that distribution, hence we're finding out that's where there's an opportunity to grow and that's obviously very profitable business. I would say for each category of service that a distributor provides, whether it's demand creation or fulfillment, I think the amount you pay for that has come down, and I would say especially in the fulfillment side kind of the margins, all companies within semiconductors for fulfillment that, that margin has come down due to sort of the competitive nature."
1,"Speaking of strategic acquisitions, our integration of the Finagaz business remains on schedule and we expect the integration process to conclude this fiscal year. I will return later on the call to comment on our strategic initiatives, but I'd like to turn it over to Kirk at this point for the financial review. Kirk?"
1,"Specific to the independent channel, customers exposed to mining and energy markets continue to grow at above average rates. The macro factors driving Aftermarket sales are compounded by benefits from our strategic initiatives including thoughtful acquisitions and innovative technology. Hy-Pro, which we acquired last year, added 3% to Aftermarket's growth last quarter."
1,"Starting on slide 3, Our Holiday Season same-store sales declined 5. 3%, reflecting positive progress on our strategic priorities, offset primarily by the negative impact of the credit outsourcing transition as evidenced by the mixed performance across our banners and channels. As we've communicated previously, we are keenly focused on addressing our challenges and transforming Signet into a market-leading omni-channel retailer, positioned for growth through strong execution on our strategic priorities."
1,"Starting with our Nutrition business, let's go to page 10. In 2017, Nutrition again outperformed its aspiration as outlined in our Strategy 2018 with full year sales increasing 8% organically, clearly above market, and reflecting the successful implementation of our growth initiatives in both Animal and Human Nutrition. The nutrition improvement programs, covering the cost reductions, as well as operational excellence further helped grow our adjusted EBITDA that closed 13% up over prior year, repeating the excellent EBITDA growth performance that was achieved already in 2016 with a similar 13% EBITDA growth."
1,Store business is strong and we've got pretty good momentum. Our strategy remains the same and we execute against that very focused and very diligently. The change is that we're now moving from a fixing mindset to a leading mindset.
1,"Suffice it to say, we believe we have a good plan and a good leadership team that is executing well across the board, giving us confidence in our outlook. We continue to deliver well on our strategic initiatives and we continue to do more and better for our key stakeholders, for our customers, our colleagues, and the communities that we serve. We remain focused on raising our capital return to shareholders."
1,Suppliers with strong cluster and infotainment solutions have an inherent advantage in offering these integrated cockpit domain controller solutions. Our strategic initiatives in 2016 and 2017 have helped the company gain momentum in the Audio/Infotainment segment. Our acquisition of AllGo Systems in 2016 has strengthened our hand in the Display Audio segment.
1,"Sure. As far as spending for technology, clearly, technology and process improvements are at the forefront of our strategy. So I don't expect any material slowdown in spending."
1,"Sure. I mean we've outlined our four key growth strategic initiatives to help us stabilize the business and get back to growth. I'll tell you we'd start with relentless focus on customers and really paying attention to what our customers are telling us, and I think our team has done a nice job with that."
1,"Sure. I think one of the key points around the way we approach strategic planning is that we actually go through the process, and out of the process comes execution items that we actually execute against. So, I believe that a huge part of any successful strategic planning process has to be the execution that comes out of it, and as you look at that slide, you can see what we did in 2009 and 2014, and how that's really added to where the company is today from a financial performance and risk and growth perspective."
1,"Sure. Our strategy of differentiation is based around providing solutions. We not only provide hardware and we have the fab that goes ahead and creates high-performance components and makes high-performance measurements to provide great, let's just say, measurement integrity."
1,"Sure. Really, when we do an acquisition, it's got to be something that promotes our strategy. And if you think about it in oversimplified terms, we're doing one or two things."
1,"Sure. So Zale is a good example of where all of our strategic initiatives are beginning to take hold, unencumbered by any credit issues, so none of the same process or in-store selling complications that we're seeing in Sterling. Our improved assortment that we had in the bridal and fashion drove comp sales growth in both of those parts of the business in Zale."
1,"Sure. So, I showed the chart with our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Maximize cash flow for the enterprise, make sure we have the right optimal capital structure, which we do today."
1,Sure. We think we're making very good progress against the strategic plans that we laid out a couple of years ago. We've executed on everything that we've committed to our shareholders and investors.
1,"tax deferred liability as we re-measure down to the new 21% corporate tax rate. There's more work to perform in our tax strategy, but we initially estimate CECO will yield $1 million to $2 million of tax savings starting in 2018. This is certainly good news."
1,"Tax Reform to result in strong double-digit growth in both full year reported and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2018, including the investments behind the strategic initiatives noted earlier are still expected to be approximately $110 million. While we're working to execute important strategic initiatives, including the test of the new Sally Beauty loyalty program, investments in our e-commerce fulfillment capabilities and more effective marketing platform, compelling new product introductions and the implementation of a new point-of-sale system and new merchandise and supply chain platform, we will continue to seek opportunities to run our business more efficiently, both within our own organization and be in more productive partnerships with outside service providers."
1,"Tax reform will be a significant earnings tailwind for us in fiscal 2019 as we plan to flow through all of the benefits to our shareholders. The strength of our high-growth model already enables us to reinvest in our strategic priorities every single year. As Lee and Peter shared, we remain committed to improving our customer value proposition, which means delivering a compelling merchandising assortment at an extreme value."
1,"tax reform, I would like to review our capital allocation policy, which we continue to believe drive significant value for our customers, shareholders and employees. We aim to preserve financial flexibility in order to have the resources to execute our strategy and drive long-term value creation. We will continue to invest in attractive opportunities to drive organic growth while balancing profitability over the long term even if those investments are dilutive in the near term."
1,"Tax Reform. Additionally, we believe the steps we're taking to fully leverage our scale and clout with third-parties and find meaningful efficiencies in every corner of our operations will enable us to fund the important strategic initiatives that Chris just discussed. And we believe that successful execution of these initiatives is crucial to positioning the company for profitable growth in future years."
1,"Tech Services also achieved profitable growth in Q4, as we again drove considerable volumes of waste into our disposal network. Before turning to more detail on the segments, let me share some thoughts on our annual results as we returned to full year profitable growth in 2017 and completed several strategic initiatives. We opened a new hazardous waste incinerator in El Dorado, Arkansas, the first such facility built in the U."
1,"Thank you all for joining the call and for your interest. As we said a couple of times, we are very pleased with the success that Kemper on its own has had in the last couple of years of attacking and achieving the results in our strategic plan. We believe we're ahead of the commitments we made there and we're excited to move to what we might have described at that time, Phase 3, in one of our businesses, and moving forward, strategically growing the organization."
1,"Thank you all for joining us this evening and more generally, thank you for trusting the process at Cedar. We are pretty sure that there will not be a victory parade for us as there was today for the Eagles when we eventually achieve our audacious goals, but we are confident that our shareholders will be gratified for having trusted this management team as we patiently executed our thoughtful and disciplined strategy. With that, I wish you all a good night."
1,"Thank you all for taking the time out and joining us for the call today. I'll commence with the highlights of performance during Q3 and YTD nine months FY 2018 and share thoughts on drivers of our strategy. And later, Dilip will share the details of operating and financial progress achieved during this period."
1,"Thank you for being a guiding leader all these years and working tirelessly to secure a bright future for the company and our teams. Speaking of the future, we're working on our strategic planning process right now that will guide our goals and vision throughout 2018 and beyond. For this year, we remain confident in the fundamental strength of our business supported by some very positive backlog and bookings trends that will help us achieve our full year guidance."
1,"Thank you for joining our call this morning to view our fourth quarter 2017 results. I'll start by providing some viewpoints on each of our four business groups, and the progress we're making on our strategic initiatives. After John Granato provides the business review, I'll conclude our prepared remarks with some comments about our current outlook for 2018."
1,"Thank you for joining us. Since transitioning to my new role in November, I have spent extensive time with our board, our executive leadership team and the exceptional talent across our organization as we continue to work together to strengthen our business to make progress toward our top strategic priorities, and to continue to build our brand. What has become even more evident to me over the past few weeks are the extensive future opportunities for the business."
1,"Thank you for taking my question. First off, could you update us on your strategy to retain more of your larger customers as they may outgrow existing services? Are you able to retain more of the large customers today versus a year ago?"
1,"Thank you for taking my question. In the release, you commented on the strategic initiatives to improve Core traffic trends. Can you explain that initiative further and kind of what negatively impacted traffic trends?"
1,"Thank you for the questions. As I think you can tell from Steven and my tone, we remain most optimistic about the company and we're very excited as we unfold our 2018 to 2020 strategic plan. We feel very good with our high-touch, value added proposition of serving customers with a wide array of value-added services, delivered through our field consultants and supported by telesales and what we believe to be world-class electronic ordering and other ways of doing business with Henry Schein and are very, very enthusiastic about the future."
1,"Thank you very much. As we think about the growth going forward and franchise sentiments, obviously, not sharing too much in terms of your 2018 or long-term plans, but you mentioned a couple of times the significant benefits of the franchisees we're going to see from tax reform and what seems like their long-term commitment is pretty strong as they accelerate their renewal program. So I'm just wondering, what's the sentiment, as you talk to these franchisees, do they seem to be keen in reinvesting over time in long-term unit growth, maybe just because the west is where a lot of this growth is going to come from."
1,"Thank you, again for joining our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings conference call. Our team's disciplined execution of our strategic plan and demonstrated record performance continue to provide a firm foundation to enhancing long-term shareholder value and underscores our confidence in Martin Marietta's long-term outlook. We very much look forward to discussing our first quarter 2018 results in April."
1,"Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to join today's call to talk about 2017 results, the implications of tax reform to Verizon, and then to talk about our strategic priorities for 2018. Let me start off by recapping our impressive performance this year."
1,"Thank you, Bret, and welcome to all of you on the call today to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, as well as our outlook for 2018. We are pleased with our solid results for this year, our success in extending our global market share and the progress we are making on our strategic initiatives. Now, I'd like to walk you through the financial results in more detail."
1,"Thank you, Darrin. So yes, we are continuing to see growing adoption of the full ecosystem, and this is a huge part of our strategy, because not only does it drive growth, but as sellers start to use more than one product they obviously become much more sticky on the platform. And so, that's one of the many reasons why we see the power of our model."
1,"Thank you, David, and good morning. John and David have already summarized our accomplishments for 2017, but let me provide a little more color on the fourth quarter and a highly eventful year, before turning to our strategy, and 2018 guidance. As discussed, we reported robust revenue and operating margins in the fourth quarter, driven by strong results across all three segments."
1,"Thank you, David, for this detailed answer. I want to ask about the non-ethylene fleet which is still a quite sizeable portion of your company and your increasing focus on the ethylene and petrochemical activities, I was wondering what is the long-term plan for this portion of the fleet. Would you consider potentially either spin it off or sell it in order to deploy this capital to the petrochemical business?"
1,"Thank you, David. On our last earnings call I described how Concertis entered the second phase of its strategic plan, the development of a clinically integrated network or CIN. A clinically integrated network is a collection of healthcare providers such as physicians, ancillary providers, and facilities that come together to improve patient care through acute treatment and ongoing condition maintenance."
1,"Thank you, Howard. To close, in 2017, we executed on our strategic priorities to reduce our cost structure, strengthen credit performance, and establish a solid profitable foundation from which to drive our long-term growth. While we are pleased with the progress we made, we are only getting started."
1,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. First, I will provide a brief overview of our performance for the quarter and review the progress we have made on our strategic initiatives. Don will then discuss our first quarter results in more detail."
1,"Thank you, Jeff. It's highly gratifying that our growth strategy is working. We're hiring high-quality reps, managing them and the sales process well, and letting them do what they do best; bringing the high-accuracy results from our FORE-SIGHT oximetry to anesthesiologists and empowering them to improve patient outcomes."
1,"Thank you, Juhani. And from the exciting world of Hatch back to exciting 2018 and how we're going to go forward with our strategy. No change in strategy, so to speak."
1,"Thank you, Kate. As I stated, we're pleased with our solid 2017 core performance and see it as evidence that we're making substantial and sustainable progress on our disciplined strategic plan to build shareholder value, by executing on our super community bank model, by growing market share, strengthening our deposit franchise, improving our core operating performance, maintaining a moderate risk profile and prudently deploying excess capital. I would like to thank all my colleagues who are driving the solid performance for our company."
1,"Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. On today's call I will discuss our third quarter results including an update on our business segments and strategic initiatives. After that, Mick will provide a more detailed review of our consolidated financial results and we'll review our revenue and earnings guidance for fiscal 2018."
1,"Thank you, Kirk. As Roger and Kirk mentioned, we made good progress during 2017 in executing our strategic plan and further de-risking the company. Overall, 2017 was another good year in the transformation of our company."
1,"Thank you, Kyle, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results were in line with our expectations and show consistent execution of our strategic priorities. As we move forward, we will continue to generate consistent earnings and strong sustainable free cash flow to further strengthen our balance sheet, provide long-term shareholder value and accelerate our transformation in Quad 3."
1,"Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Three years ago we set out a strategic plan to reshape AMD to become a high-performance computing leader through great products, deep customer relationships and a simplified and focused business strategy. 2017 marked a key product and financial inflection point for AMD."
1,"Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. As we reported our second quarter results, we continue to make a solid progress in the execution of our strategic plan as we diversify our revenue profile within our core verticals and drive efficiencies to further improve our operating fundamentals across our operations. First a quick note on the DeVry University transaction."
1,"Thank you, Lloyd, and good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us on this call. 2017 for Akzo Nobel was in many aspects an extraordinary year, but before we dive into all those elements and the numbers, I want to complement my team for making significant progress since we announced our strategy to create two focused high-performer businesses, Paints and Coatings on the one hand and Specialty Chemicals on the other. The separation of Specialty Chemicals is fully on track for April 2018 as announced and as planned and the business is now reported as discontinued operations."
1,"Thank you, Martyn. Before we take questions, I wanted to discuss some of our strategic initiatives that we believe have the ability to drive meaningful and sustainable margin expansion over time as we demonstrated in the fourth quarter while also enabling us to succeed in the growing market for mobility services. Starting with profitable revenue growth, our fully integrated demand fleet pricing yield management system which makes recommendations about both pricing and fleet based on the forecasted demand is now live in 12 markets."
1,"Thank you, Melissa, and hello everyone. We are pleased to report a strong finish to 2017 characterized by significant progress against our 2020 strategic plan with solid momentum in the business and durable internal storage revenue growth clearly demonstrated in our fourth quarter results. Moreover, the acquisition of IO Data Centers, coupled with FORTRUST earlier in the year, provides us with a platform that will not only deliver our 2020 goals for adjacent business growth, but also drives higher and sustainable growth."
1,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning. Turning to slide 16, our fourth quarter results show a continuation of the benefits from the sustained and successful execution of our strategic plan. The fourth quarter and annual comparisons exclude the effects of tax reform, which I will detail on the next slide."
1,"Thank you, Norman. As you have heard in the results section of the presentation, 2017 closed the successful delivery of our second strategic plan, and provide solid foundations for our third strategic plan, GSR3. We have a number of structural advantages which are difficult to replicate in terms of how we meet customer needs, including our differentiated multi-brand and multi-channel propositions, our customer reach as the largest banking franchise in the UK, and our leading digital capabilities."
1,"Thank you, Ruth. So, these are the three strategic priorities I outlined last year, and I'll talk to you about the progress we've made on each one. As I've said already, we believe both Online and Retail are growing at or above market rates."
1,"Thank you, Saket and good evening everyone. I'll share with you our strategic initiatives on three fronts of manufacturing, marketing and distribution. Our manufacturing strategy is to maintain high quality standards, while being a cost leader through our ability to manufacture the largest innerwear volumes at one of the lowest costs."
1,"Thank you, Sherry, and thank you everyone for joining our call. In 2017, we were focused on our strategic priorities of growing our core business, executing with excellence and capitalizing on market consolidation opportunities. We feel good about the progress we made on our strategic priorities, as we grew organically, acquired NPH and delivered operating leverage, while also benefiting from a favorable macro environment."
1,"Thank you, Stephen. Looking ahead, we aim to continue to deliver against our stated strategic priorities that we set out in our Capital Markets Day in February 2017. To do this, we have a relentless focus on superior, sustainable and growing income streams."
1,"Thank you, Sven. And if you now look at our strategy   and first of all, we established, as I said to start with, our visions for the Marine and Energy and those are definitely putting forward our strategy together. And if we see any interesting player in the market who would fit well to our strategy and improve that one, we would definitely look at it."
1,"Thank you, Todd. As noted, the fourth quarter reflected the tremendous momentum carried forward from the first three quarters of 2017, in both our leisure family-oriented lifestyle and housing and industrial markets, along with the execution of our strategic initiatives. Solid fundamental demographic trends, industry tailwinds and strong organic and strategic revenue growth continued to propel our strong operating results."
1,"Thank you, Venkatesh. Coming to the next slide, which is the strategic priorities and the growth drivers for the company, so really there are two fronts on which we are making the investments. Number one is on the sales side, and I kind of indicated some of the progress we have made in terms of the sales investments which is primarily putting the right teams and the leadership on the ground."
1,"Thank you. And just on the second area of your strategic priorities on profitability. Erich, I think you said that it will be more difficult to improve margins in 2018 or 2017."
1,"Thank you. And on your COA strategy then, you are counting on increasing COA coverage throughout this year as well, even though you're perhaps more bullish on 2019-2020, if I read it correctly. Is that how we should assume your coverage going forward or?"
1,"Thank you. I was wondering, have you articulated in the past or could you possibly articulate your thoughts on capital allocation and what you think in general your strategy with this cash might be?"
1,"Thanks again. Can you, sort of, share some thoughts on what would be your M&A or acquisition strategy, given the fact that you've indicated twice on this call that you're looking at acquisition opportunities? So what are the areas that you're looking at, what are the areas that interest you and what are the areas may be you need to acquire to build some capabilities."
1,"Thanks and good morning. So just to start, I wanted to ask about how tax reform could change your strategy on capital allocation. And I'm curious if this could drive a more aggressive approach to buybacks and/or acquisitions going forward just given the impact it could have to your leverage."
1,"Thanks for joining us today. I'm going to start by giving you a recap of substantial milestones in 2017 achieved as we executed on our strategy of building two distinct complementary business lines, with a focus on creating platforms with substantial cash flow. In our Entertainment and Communications business, the early decision to invest in fiber has once again generated both revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth."
1,"Thanks for supplying all the information, lot of stuffs to digest here. On the Lighting side of the business, what are the long-term plans for this business? Is there a possible full on exit of the business in the form of the sale?"
1,Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just you could help frame for us as you think about your initial commercialization strategy here given the profile you've seen. Maybe just walk us through the value proposition now that you've seen the top-line data.
1,"Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to start with the question on kind of your strategic priorities that you outlined, really just the question is that kind of signals your priority for investment at this point. So now you've acquired Shone Lumber, really is there an expectation for accelerating M&A at this point or following that deal, I guess, has the priority now shifted back towards internal investment?"
1,"Thanks for the question, Vincent. So on capital allocation and the GSK stake, the GSK stake is a financial stake for us, where we put these two businesses together with an expectation we would drive synergies, and we have a clear strategic plan we've agreed on with the leadership of the consumer group at GSK. Now, what we see going forward is an opportunity to fully realize the value of that stake as that business plan is executed."
1,"Thanks, Ashish. 2017 has been a successful year for the company as we continued to execute against our objectives of increasing growth as well as improving retention and academic outcomes. I'm very pleased with the progress we have made since 2014, improving from an operating loss of approximately $140 million to our outlook for operating profit of $84 million to $91 million for 2018."
1,"Thanks, Bill. Before turning the conference call over to you for your questions, I'd like to conclude our prepared remarks with a review of our 2018 strategic priorities. We remain focused on achieving strong financial performance, delivering customized banking solutions to our clients, and driving momentum in our businesses by balancing our growth expenses and our investments."
1,"Thanks, Bill. Our outlook for 2018 is generally consistent with our recently provided three-year strategic plan, and indicates another year of strong revenue and earnings growth with excellent cash flow generation. Our recent results reflect the ongoing execution of our strategy, and we believe we are well-positioned to generate increased shareholder returns throughout our three-year plan."
1,"Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone who joined us today. We are excited about Cornerstone's transformation and what it means for the future and we are pleased with the rapid pace of execution against our strategic plan. As always, I want to especially thank our global team for all of their great work during this transition to help more than 35 million people around the world to realize their potential."
1,"Thanks, Brian. I'll close with a recap of our strategic priorities that we continue to focus on to drive value to our partners, cardholders, and shareholders. A top priority is to continue to execute across our three sales platforms, building upon our capabilities in marketing, analytics, loyalty, and digital and mobile technology."
1,"Thanks, Bryan. 2017 was another strong year for Black Knight, as we continue to execute against our long-term strategic initiatives to drive organic growth and increase shareholder return. In particular, we expanded our relationships with several key new client wins in existing markets, continued down the path of creating the enterprise relationships with our substantial client base and create value through the spin-off, debt refinancing and share repurchase program."
1,"Thanks, Darren. Before we begin taking questions, I want to thank our entire Rite Aid team for all they've done during the quarter from helping us reach an important milestone in the transfer process to focusing on our TSA and supporting our go-forward strategic priorities. These efforts are complex and also require hard work."
1,"Thanks, David. For 2017, we laid out a number of strategic priorities including the active runoff of AAC and its subsidiaries, loss recovery to litigation, and the exercise of contractual and legal rights, improved cost effectiveness and efficiency of the operating platforms, rationalization of Ambac's capital and liability structures leading to a simplified corporate governance structure and the successful exit from rehabilitation of the Segregated Account and the exploration of selective business transactions that would offer attractive risk-adjusted returns and enable utilization of Ambac's net operating losses. We are pleased to report that we've made significant progress with respect to all of our stated objectives and are continuing to advance against each."
1,"Thanks, Eric. And I'd like to reiterate our commitment to a defined strategy of creating a simplified and integrated midstream company with the ability to participate in the entire midstream value chain. I think it is important to note that while we have made significant strides in executing on the strategy in 2017, we're not finished."
1,"Thanks, Judd. In fiscal 2018, we celebrated five years as a management team with superior performance in both new and existing stores, significant earnings growth and meaningful progress against our strategic initiatives. Our industry is growing, our product is fresh and exciting and our core customer relationships are strengthening."
1,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. On the call today, in addition to talking about results for the fiscal quarter and our objectives, and outlook for the near term, we're also going to spend some time today talking about activities that have gone on over the past three quarters to four quarters, those being product-,customer-related, operations related to get everyone back up to speed on the company, and also talk about how those activities have not only built the foundation for the results that you see today, but we look forward to those activities building additional revenue growth and profitability as we go forward. Talking about some of the key things that are going on right now, overall business environment remains very strong, and that's across multiple market segments."
1,"Thanks, Mark. 2017 was another very busy and productive year for Rayonier, and I wanted to take a moment to recap some of the key milestones we achieved in executing on a number of our strategic priorities. In March, we announced that the company had entered into three transactions to acquire approximately 95,000 acres of high quality timberlands located in coastal Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, which subsequently closed for a final purchase price of $214 million or roughly $2,250 per acre."
1,"Thanks, Mary. So now let me spend a few minutes to talk about our near-term strategic initiatives and how we will grow the business over time. For our wholly-owned assets, we continue to focus on maximizing cash flow growth while being opportunistic in selling mature assets and redeploying the cash into new higher growth opportunities."
1,"Thanks, Rob. Turning to 2018, our strategic priorities are clear, and we'll continue to get after them with urgency. We'll pursue our best growth opportunities in Personal Care, Key Account Management, and growing our Coatings business in Asia."
1,"Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. In 2017, UPS made significant progress on our strategic initiatives, expanding our capabilities, implementing new technology and further penetrating high-growth markets. The successful execution of our growth strategies was apparent in the strong revenue gains made across all segments of the business."
1,"Thanks, Shelley, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter performance continues to demonstrate our commitment to delivering on the successful execution of our strategic initiatives. We believe we are gaining traction in our business and exceeded our expectations on the top and bottom line."
1,"Thanks, Tim. In the most challenging environment we have seen for REITs in a number of years, I am pleased to report Q4 2017 financial results, our outlook for 2018 and some important strategic initiatives that all speak to our optimism about the power of the Welltower platform. We run this business to be the most effective global capital and operating partner to the broad healthcare delivery landscape, including seniors housing and have not been afraid to make bold decisions regarding people, capital deployment, asset mix, and operator alignment to ensure our ability to drive our strategy and deliver shareholder value for years to come."
1,"Thanks, Tom. We are pleased with our quarter and full year results, and the progress we made against our strategic plan. We demonstrated our ability to maximize value by strongly growing our premium beverage alcohol business and our Distillery Products segment, and reestablishing our plant-based protein platform with TruTex in our Ingredient Solutions segment."
1,"Thanks, Ward. The acquisition of KapStone aligns extremely well with our strategy. The addition of KapStone strengthens our North American Corrugated Packaging business; it provides meaningful synergy and performance improvement opportunities; and it's very attractive financially."
1,"Thanks. And just as a follow-up, you guys talked about reinvestments in strategic initiatives. I wanted to get a sense of where you expect some of the returns on these investments will be reflected."
1,"Thanks. Could we just go back to the strategic initiatives that we saw booked in the first half, just wondering if you could give us a sense as to what sort of spend will come through that line over the remainder of the year and perhaps into the future?"
1,"Thanks. I think as you can see, we're very pleased with the progress that we've made on our strategic initiatives during the first half of the year. And we also want to just reiterate our welcome to our colleagues from WorkMarket to ADP, and we look forward to the success we're going to have together."
1,"Thanks. In terms of our brand strategy, obviously, I think the most important aspect for how customers are using banks is more through the digital side. So, the digital channels are becoming much more important."
1,"Thanks. Just wondering within the context of your strategic plan, how you guys think about the implications from the big announced Blackstone deal to acquire the Financial & Risk business from Thomson Reuters? And whether that shake up might yield any opportunities for Nasdaq to either grow faster organically or inorganically or perhaps even look to monetize some pieces?"
1,"Thanks. Yeah, so curious more about the strategic initiative or strategic push into retail that you said will be accentuated. I'm curious is that just more of what Clarke was just speaking to of the near-prime auto or are there other initiatives within retail that you'll focus on more fully?"
1,"That fosters competition and ensures the best netbacks for our product. For our Southwest PA gas the option is not necessarily plant choice, but whether or not we process the gas in the first place, our blending strategy that you've already heard Andrea mention. We use this optionality every day to adjust to changing market conditions and really to optimize our revenue."
1,"That is a constant in our business and we're getting it everywhere and we're making pretty good progress in many areas on that and that we will continue. Second one, we have our Accelerate program, which is about speeding up our strategy. Biggest impact of that will be how we can increase our growth going forward."
1,"That is our top priority, so thank you in advance for your patience during this period. But once we are on a clear path forward, we intend to openly share our strategy and discuss our pipeline in detail with all of you. Just as I have been involved in building other companies in the Roivant family, I am energized by the opportunity to help rebuild Axovant, and I look forward to presenting a more fulsome update on our strategy by the middle of the year."
1,"That is why we announced to our teams today that all Macy's associates will be part of an incentive plan in 2018. The plan is designed to support our growth strategy. And this is part-time, full-time, hourly, seasonally, every associate has a role to play in our performance and a stake to win in our success."
1,"That is why, I want to assure you that neither I nor to my knowledge Baring Vostok are going to proceed with another secondary placement in 2018. The management team and I are focused on pursuing our development strategy, and we will update you on the results on a regular basis. Thank you for your attention."
1,"That means that we are moving to a dividend yield of something close to 4%, so above our peers. And with regard to the dividend policy, it will be reviewed on the occasion of the approval of our strategic plan. So the decision of the Board of Directors was let's make a decision on the 2017 dividend, an 80% payout ratio seems appropriate."
1,"That performance placed us just below the midpoint of the S&P 500. While this is disappointing, we continue to believe our disciplined growth strategy and prudent use of capital will support achievement of our top third goal. We believe the macro environment should support modest growth in our end markets over the next few years."
1,"That said, given the ever-changing and challenging environment in which we operate, we fully realize that we can't afford to rest on our laurels. Our commitment to staying relevant and to being best-in-class will enable our deep and talented team to continue to capitalize on our unequaled combination of strategic advantages to execute our strategy and to grow shareholder value. Lisa?"
1,"That said, I want you to know that our attention remains on executing our strategy for delivering value to our policyholders, and our shareholders. And we are confident that we will achieve our objectives as discussed on our December outlook call. So with that, I'll turn the program over to Teresa, who'll provide you an update on Aflac U."
1,"That was a little bit of a surprise. But otherwise, we're continuing to see some pretty good traction on some of our strategic initiatives we've had in the past and implemented in the last couple of years."
1,"That was all the different business areas. Now, RenÃ© Schneider, he will take over and take you through an update on the strategic initiatives, as well as the financial numbers."
1,"That's a good follow-on question, Michael. We   I think, I've been consistent in saying last five years that, being an organic growth company and an acquirer that part of our strategy historically really for 30 years now has been to take what the market allows you to have and to be opportunistic around where the best situations are to create shareholder value, meaning create accretion to earnings, create tangible book value growth for our company long-term. That said, a wise person once told me, you should always be talking to three or four or five banks that are much bigger than you are, that you have good relationships with."
1,"That's a really good point, Ross, because we spend a lot of time internally and have just gone through a few-month process where we were sort of laying out our three to five year strategic plan. And the reality of the opportunity facing us and where we are in that opportunity is that there is a lot more that we could go after that we want to go after than frankly we'll be able to go after."
1,"That's as much as I think I can comment on that. Now with the coming back, of course, our strategy from the very beginning has been not only rely on geothermal, but rather to have the whole assortment of heat pumps and not only to rely on residential, but also rely on the commercial. But that's why CGC came onboard."
1,"That's helpful. And I guess I just had one general question left just in regard to once the deal is closed, does the company plan to update what was provided on the Investor Day, as far as the long-term outlook, the strategic plan that was set forth to 2021?"
1,"That's helpful. And when I think about some of the key strategic priorities that you and the senior management team have executed upon highlighted last year, what comes top of mind is the progress you made in expanding the customer base, continuing to innovate new products, driving further operating efficiencies, something near and dear to your heart. We don't expect you to take the foot off the gas on any of that in 2018, but what sort of additions, changes, subtractions, should we think about for this year more broadly for CME compared to sort of the last few years?"
1,"That's how we look at it. Ironically, the decision to expand internationally more aggressively was the result of our last three-year cycle of strategy. And after a meaningful forethought about what customers are asking us to do, it continues to be an excellent decision and there's excellent execution."
1,That's what we are working toward. We are confident in our strategy and the ability of our team to execute. We have a track record of delivering on our objectives.
1,"That's what we can do around Population Health Services. So you kind of think about our strategy as really along those lines as looking for areas where the technology can really go dramatically change the workflow and the cost model as we move forward. And the fact that healthcare is under such pressure, as Bill talked about, actually means there's a ton of opportunity and people are willing to start to think about some things in a different way."
1,"That's what we do. We sell a good crane at the right price, backed by even better warranty and service support, that's our simple strategy."
1,"That's why we drive high client retention rates across our book of business and it's why I am incredibly confident that this combined enterprise will outpace the market in terms of bringing open architected new solutions that work at individual plan levels. So I feel very, very confident that whether you're a national employer, a middle market employer, a governmental agency, a union, a health plan, we're going to have solutions that work for you and help you achieve your objectives, and this is all going to further that."
1,"The acquisition of the Prudential Vietnam Finance Company announced last month is also part of our strategy to identify new growth engines and will contribute substantially to accelerating globalization. Secondly, our differentiated loan growth strategy of focusing on non-audited SMEs and improving NIM had led to the group's interest income growth for three consecutive quarters. This year as well, through our differentiated growth strategy focusing on SMEs, and based on systematic adjustment of the portfolio anchored on profitability, we will continue to expand our interest income base, a key source of profitability for the group."
1,"The acquisition represents a value accretive and synergistic opportunity for us. We'll believe this along with our Fine Fragrance Creation Studio in Amsterdam will strengthen our strategy to expand our presence and product offerings primarily in the focus growth areas of fine fragrance, beauty products and fabric care. In combination with our Tanishka acquisition partnership this gives us a very strong platform for fabric care development going forward."
1,"The additional year-over-year increase of $1. 1 million was driven primarily by the transformation expense related to our strategic initiatives, as well as several hundred thousands in license fees related to sales force. The transformation expense has now wound down and will be less in Q3."
1,The aggregate value of these appraisals is consistent with the fair market value we have estimated in the past. We continue to view our real estate as a valuable resource for additional capital liquidity and potential strategic initiatives for the company. It's been another productive quarter for BlueLinx.
1,"The amount, period, and timing of the return of these amounts to our customers will be determined by our regulators in each of our jurisdictions. As Curtis described, the results of tax reform will reduce our cash flows but this will not change our business strategy or capital investment plans. We will continue to focus on being a premier natural gas company by investing in our systems to safely deliver natural gas to our more than 2."
1,"The approximately 70,000 square feet of lease expirations in 2019 enable us to create value with a spec-suite leasing strategy focused on creating flexible space solutions with shared amenities and an increased speed to market, where more tenants pay a premium for all three. We have had tremendous success at our spec-suite leasing strategy at 1600 Wilson, which offers $40 rents and is 98% occupied. We feel confident that this strategy will work in Arlington Tower, because there are a limited number of Class A small suites in Rosslyn that offer rents in the $51 to $55 gross range and among those Arlington Tower is the only building with views according to CoStar data."
1,"The bar on the far right shows the original target of $475 million that we laid out to everybody on Investor Day last March. So, less than a year after we rolled out our strategic plan, we've increased our organic growth target materially. Keep in mind that this chart, that is Strategy 1."
1,"The board concluded the issues of greatest concern to Mr. Griege are best addressed with the company's current strategic plan, which has thus far produced extraordinary growth, diversification and shareholder value since our IPO in 2012, and transformed HomeStreet from a troubled thrift into a regional community bank with a diversified array of products and services doing business in the best markets in the nation. As with other shareholders, we continue to offer to engage with Mr."
1,"The bottom line is that we are taking steps today across the board to position Ameren for success in 2018, the next five years, the next decade, and beyond. Moving to page 10, I am firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2018 and beyond will deliver superior value to our customers and our shareholders. We believe the earnings and rate base growth rates I just discussed compare favorably with those of our regulated utility peers."
1,"The brand has broad customer appeal, driven by desirable, competitively priced models which are defined by Japanese quality and which are especially well-suited for the local market preferences. This deal also furthers evidences the continued delivery of our Ignite strategy and Inchcape's ability to leverage our unique position in a highly fragmented industry. So, thank you for listening to all of you."
1,The business responded well and we expect earnings will be higher than last year. We continue to make good progress against these strategic priorities we've spoken about for the last few years and these are contributing the PBIT growth. And finally our long-term growth potential remains substantial.
1,"The buyer has a $13 million deposit at risk and the transaction is anticipated to close early in the second quarter. This sale is another example of Host executing on a strategic initiative, which was to reduce our exposure to New York. This hotel has been a particularly poor performer and requires substantial CapEx."
1,The change in CFO is not a change in our strategy. The change in CFO is not a change in the way we are pursuing our M&A strategy. We have a very good pipeline.
1,"The chart to the right also shows Boardwalk's operational capital investment for the 2017 year. Building exteriors, appliances and suite renovations and upgrades comprised 71% of operational capital investment or approximately CAD 167 million of operational CapEx spending, a reflection of Boardwalk's new repositioning and rebranding strategic initiative. To date, the Trust has seen success on its repositioning, rebranding and upgrading strategy."
1,"The company is today on solid footing with a clear pure-play focus and streamlined operations. Now, our entire team is focused on the final phase of our strategy, which is achieving top line growth. I look forward to successfully overcoming Volt's remaining challenges and emerging as a stronger company."
1,"The consolidated PAT net of controlling interest is up significantly from INR 30 crores to INR 43 crores due to favorable tax structure in the EOC operations. In summary, Tata Coffee is firmly focused on stakeholder value creation through a mix of strategic initiatives, premiumization, differentiation and disintermediation and near-term interventions like cost optimization across business lines and new customer acquisitions. These initiatives will help us stay focused on our mission statement of long-term value creation for all our stakeholders."
1,"The Consumer business, dmg media, experienced a slight fall in underlying revenues with the decline in circulation and print advertising revenues being mostly offset by the continued digital revenue growth from MailOnline. We have been working hard on implementing our performance improvement program to improve operational execution, one of our three strategic priorities. Although we are at an early stage of implementation, we have been encouraged by the pace of change and delivery across the group."
1,"The consumer direct slide on the bottom left illustrates a slight increase in the year-over-year production and a dip in production compared to our third quarter results, again, due to seasonality. The graph on the bottom right illustrates our ongoing balance sheet realignment strategy. As you can see, our indirect production is down substantially over Q4 2016 and down slightly from the third quarter of 2017."
1,"The date of this call is February 12, 2018. Our discussion today contains forward-looking statements about events and circumstances that have not yet occurred, including without limitations, statements regarding our objectives for future operations and future financial and business performance. These forward-looking statements are based upon our current expectations and beliefs and on information currently available to us."
1,"The dividend increase reflects the confidence we have in our business. All of our business segments achieved their strategic priorities in 2017, and our goal for 2018 is to stay on course and to continue to grow both revenue and EBITDA. I'd like to thank all of our shareholders for your confidence, and our team for all of their hard work, and we look forward to seeing you at our Annual General Meeting at the TMX Broadcast Centre on April 26 at 10 AM."
1,"The dynamics have reduced tax expense, dividend payments and share repurchases should result in sustainable returns above our historical target, so we are increasing our ROE target to a range of 20% to 25%. Our financial goals represent our objectives for the whole of 2018. It's important to remember that the commercial real estate business can be variable over the course of the year with the first quarter typically being the lightest from an overall volume perspective."
1,"The early response to this additional feature has been positive, and we'll continue to explore opportunities going forward that add versatility to how our customers can shop our online and physical stores. Now to our third strategic initiative, increasing the penetration of our exclusive brand portfolio and expanding our merchandise margins. We continue to grow this important piece of our business, which not only further differentiates Boot Barn from our competitors but also contributes meaningfully towards expanding our merchandise margin."
1,"The employees are realizing the significant impact they have on our profit, growth, and equity spurring a renewed sense of alignment within the organization. I strongly believe that our people and the strength of our evolving culture is pivotal in helping us successfully execute our strategy. Every single day, I see our people come into work with an entrepreneurial spirit, commitment to innovation, and a desire to forge a strong sense of camaraderie both across our organization and with our external partners."
1,"The end results of the work that we did, we're able to reduce our debt by almost $40 million in the year and reduced our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 2. 5, and what that does is, it sets us up well to continue with our strategy of looking at M&A as a growth trajectory for us. And we established a nice acquisition pipeline throughout the year and we're very happy with where we sit there."
1,"The essence of these pillars are a clear focus on our strengths to optimize our current positions in core areas while selectively and intentionally pushing our boundaries outside our core as we drive forward for growth. These strategic pillars we've translated into strategic priorities, and they are about maintaining and growing our leadership position in GPN, sustaining current and driving further ingredient market leadership in Nutritional Solutions; growing through organic investment programs and acquisitions and partnerships with complementary businesses; and of course, all of these priorities delivered by a very clear and committed focus on developing our talent, our culture, and our value system in line with our growing and global scale. For 2018, our outlook is positive and we aim to continue our growth journey."
1,"The executive are now focused on opportunities to improve our market share, build real competitive advantage, and transform the business into a broader health services company. Health services expansion is core to our strategy and we continue to invest in and scale our out-of-hospital network and services. A further one or two more modest acquisitions, as I noted, are possible in the second half."
1,"The extrusion group, however, benefited from widespread strength with higher revenues and improved profitability at each of the division's five operating locations. I'd now like to touch on our various strategic initiatives. Within our Automotive Solutions segment, we are generally focused on; one, improving various measures of diversity; two, growing our content per vehicle; and three, actively seeking acquisitions that can enhance these measures."
1,"The first one is on banking union, with the debate seems to be gaining momentum this year, at least to extrapolate from the increasing pressure on the non-performing loans issue in Italy. From your perspective, what do you think a banking union roadmap could look like and how do you think you need to adapt your strategy or position the group going forward? The second question is on the operating trends."
1,"The first one is on Brazil prices. I would like to get some color on your intake pricing strategy for 2018 and on the nature of the discounts you were offering, so we can have some more visibility on the seasonality of your margins here in the region. This is the first question."
1,"The first opportunity is simply to pay out the revolver balances which will help us on our interest line a bit. Beyond that, I think it will be an element of the strategic plan to give you some of the further ideas about how to spend our cash."
1,"The foundation we have in place today coupled with the plan we have put forth should result in operating leverage as we grow the franchise and improve the earnings profile. It is important to note that our vision and plan we have laid out is a long-term plan aligned with our three-year strategic planning efforts. Along those lines, you should expect a good deal of this work we have described, the great majority of which is already in flight."
1,"The fourth quarter of 2017 at recent period were marked by a number of notable milestones for RNAi, for Alnylam, and for the patients we serve. In this period, we have come closer than ever to delivering on the promise of RNAi and have taken a big step towards fulfilling our Alnylam 2020 strategy of building a multi-product, global commercial-stage company with a deep and sustainable clinical pipeline and a robust product engine by the end of 2020. A company profile rarely achieved in biotech history."
1,"The fourth quarter was a fitting end to another year of increasing momentum in our business. Our trend-right value price assortment of everyday and seasonal home dÃ©cor, coupled with the progress we've made on our strategic initiative, continue to drive strong results in both our new and existing markets across the country. Fourth quarter sales, net sales grew 25%, including a 5."
1,"The goal of strategic cost management is not to just cut costs, the goal is to deliver long-term growth. It is a thoughtful approach of reallocating resources to strategic initiatives, while finding efficiencies and synergies throughout the organization. The Fontanini, Columbus, Grocery Products, supply chain and deli integrations are in progress."
1,"The growth was broad-based across each Industrial product line. Many of our highest value products are in this segment, and they are core to our growth strategy. As such, we are prioritizing investment of resources in capital here to expand our global presence in most of our Industrial products."
1,"The healthcare pipeline for fiscal year 2019 looks strong. As I mentioned last quarter, we are focused on our strategic initiatives around further developing our distribution network and building upon delivery of high design and innovative products to gain market share in all of our vertical markets. Sales of new products were 18% of our total sales during the second quarter."
1,"The increase in SG&A expense across both periods is primarily due to commercialization activities for INGREZZA, including the hiring of our sales force. Our cash investment receivables position as of December 31, 2017 was nearly $800 million, positioning us well to execute our near-term company strategy. Now, looking ahead to 2018, we remain encouraged by the initial results of the INGREZZA launch and the positive clinical feedback received by our customers."
1,"The investment is delivering a payback in less than two years. Moving on to geographic expansion, we have executed well on this component of our strategy with one-third of our sales now generated internationally. We are currently focused on the previously announced restructuring initiatives in Technical Nonwovens to optimize our footprint and capabilities in Europe and China."
1,"The long-term opportunity for our franchise gas business Louisiana is to continue serving large industrial customers who consume significant volumes of gas, and large LNG suppliers who export to markets worldwide. Our sixth growth strategy centers around our opportunity to repurpose redundant gas pipeline infrastructure in Louisiana into higher value service. This strategy is interesting in a couple of ways."
1,"The lower adjusted operating expenses were primarily due to lower sales and marketing costs that resulted from the restructuring of our commercial pain business. Earlier, Paul discussed certain strategic priorities that we identified a year ago. One of those priorities is to drive margin expansion through operational execution and continuous improvement."
1,"The main drivers of the decline are straightforward, namely improved earnings and continued working capital improvements. Slide 12 please, where we show dividend and payout ratio and ROIC, both clear strategic priorities of SAIL'22. As you may recall, we have clear capital allocation targets as part of SAIL'22."
1,The main takeaway here is that we're making meaningful investments to position us even more strongly from a product perspective. Our strategy is to continue building off best-of-breed email encryption solution to provide a suite of email protection solutions that are targeted to serve customers in compliance industries in the mid-market segment. Our solutions help assure compliance and security in an easy to use and cost effective manner.
1,"The market in Australia, in particularly, looks strong. And we're going to continue to evaluate those two businesses and make sure that the risk rewards there and that they're aligned with our strategic priorities. But we feel like the restructuring is coming to an end now for Infrastructure Solutions and unlike what we see for the future."
1,"The negative impacts of Paramount's legacy slate are largely behind us and we are looking forward to welcoming in a new era at the studio with the fiscal 2019 slate. We are extremely pleased with our progress and believe that the execution of our strategic initiatives will continue to deliver results. And with that, I would like to turn it back to Bob."
1,"The next leg of growth will be driven by increased NOAC penetration of the OAC market and increase Eliquis share gain of the class, or non-class. And this sort of gain is expected to be achieved by increasing focus on the following strategic initiatives. We are going to accelerate markets that are gaining with the market, and those markets will have achieved a leadership position in the risk reduction already."
1,"The number of homes sold and closed within the same quarter increased 15% year-over-year to 266, which represented approximately 25% of total closings for the quarter. As we've discussed on previous call, our spec start strategy has not only allowed us to meet strong demand of needs-based buyers that want to move in quickly, but has also enabled us to manage cycle times, direct construction costs and deliveries on a more consistent basis. Additionally, with shorter escrows, our buyers are less impacted by mortgage interest rate volatility by having the ability to lock their rates at the time of contract versus buyers with a longer build and escrow period."
1,"The one thing I would supplement Keith's comments on and I completely agree with what he said is that due to tax reform, we will probably have an incremental $200 million of cash to spend. And so, could we allocate that $200 million to one of the legs of our capital allocation strategy over the course of the next two years? Absolutely, that could be the case."
1,"The other issues were really largely related to Ever Us not performing as strongly as a year ago, it's in a lifecycle of a mature product, and still was very strong, it still is our strongest brands in the portfolio, but just not nearly as strong as last year, and our promotions were a bit less effective in Kay, largely we think due also to the complications surrounding credit. So, Zale, we think is a very good example of how these strategic initiatives are starting to come to life and beginning to deliver positive sales performance."
1,"The other thing that was really important as well, at the end of the year we completed the acquisition of Sevcon, which is a leader in power electronics capabilities and technologies. And as Rod alluded to there in his opening remarks, that's an integral part of our strategy as we combine our existing technology with additional power electronics technology. Also, for those of you that were in Investor Day at the backend of last year, that was where we shared for the first time our 2020 revenue outlook of $11."
1,"The outlook for both segments is favorable due to market conditions, actions we have already taken, and long-term agreements with customers already in place. We are focused on executing our business plan and our strategic initiatives. As a result, we believe that 2018 will be a year of continued revenue growth, operating margin improvement, and healthy cash flow generation for ATI."
1,"The past year was one featuring significant change for our company from a regulatory operational and organizational perspective. After undergoing a complete review of all aspects of our operations and developing a set of corporate strategic initiatives that we've discussed in detail on prior calls, we began 2018 with greater clarity and focus. We made significant strides in strengthening our investment management organization by investing in our people, technology resources and risk management capabilities."
1,"The payments industry is expanding and offers rich and broad set of growth opportunities for us. And we will build on our existing strengths by focusing on our investments on four strategic priorities that extend across our businesses to drive growth. So next, we'll talk about how our three businesses leverage our differentiated business model to take advantage of those opportunities for growth."
1,"The problem really hasn't manifested itself for us broadly across the board. Our spec strategy, our disciplined starting program of working to a given absorption in a community has allowed us to get the labor we need. From a high level, we monitor overall build times to see if we're having issues delivering homes, and we've not seen any kind of elongation in our build cycle by our field production teams."
1,"The products are differentiated in the market, and customer opportunities are increasing with clear cross-selling opportunities emerging. So, as we move into 2018, our strategic priorities will center on five areas. Commercial and operational integration of Spectrum, including revenue and cost synergies, acceleration of market adoption in Asia, capacity expansion programs and operating margin improvements, next generation product development and new product launches in filtration and chromatography, and finally continued expansion of market share through organic growth and M&A."
1,"The program is designed to highlight BSG's commitment to being the place for licensed professionals to learn, be inspired, and reach their full potential. To summarize, we made solid progress in the first quarter on key strategic initiatives but acknowledge that we have yet to see the results in the top line. While we recognize that we have a great deal of work to do, we firmly believe we are working on the right initiatives that will help improve the company's revenue trend, particularly in our U."
1,"The PTAB will render its validity decisions on Akamai's remaining four patents in the coming months and any patent that survives these challenges will be eligible for a future trial. Looking ahead at 2018, our long-term strategic priorities will continue to be creating customers for life, growing profitable revenue while generating cash and improving our position as employer of choice. We're also well-positioned to add significant and innovative features and capabilities and have added this as a key strategic priority."
1,"The quarter saw strong volume growth, excellent cash flow performance, positive pricing and EBITDA dollars improving despite raw material pricing, which was up significantly year-over-year. Our performance this quarter is well aligned with our strategic plan, which is to grow in Engineering Adhesives and emerging markets while maintaining strong margin performance in our core European and Americas business. I'll end my comments with a brief update on our integration work."
1,"The right deal for us, it has to fit in our strategy and we like proprietary processes, because in this business you're not buying a asset base, you're really acquiring a group of people that run a business with relationship with customers and suppliers and that needs to be maintained. And so periods of transition create risk in our acquisition strategy and we're cognizant of that and we're very careful about how we approach that. Second, our organization integrates the acquisitions we do onto our proprietary platform, which is we believe unique in our industry."
1,"The Sainsbury's changes combined with the exit of British Gas and the choices made by Homebase's new management in 2016 meant that our prospects to add new partners of scale beyond the existing base became more limited. This left us with fewer options to generate additional value for our company, as well as for collectors and still meet Sainsbury's strategic priorities. For those reasons, we mutually agreed to pursue a sale."
1,"The second pillar is on functional optimization and it includes functions like the one that I lead in finance, where we're focused on driving greater centers of excellence and shared services across the entire global platform to become more effective and efficient. And the third is on commercial optimization, where we're focused on leveraging things that touch the customer, but are considered a little bit more back office like customer service, like contract administration, driving, increasing shared services against those areas as well as looking at our go-to market strategy, directly touching the customer and ensuring that we're evolving appropriately with the evolution of our customer base. And so, it's focused on three pillars."
1,"The second, we have to execute our 2018 business plan with excellence. It's the last year of our current strategic plan, and so we want to finish the job. And third, lead a comprehensive review to develop a new strategic framework for the next three to five years."
1,"The sector has a long runway and investor demand and that should continue to produce strong levels of investment in student housing, facilitating the execution of our capital recycling activities. Turning to capital recycling, we are pleased to announce that we have made significant progress on the strategic initiatives we mentioned on last quarter's call to explore joint ventures and our core dispositions in order to fund our highly accretive development pipeline. With regards to joint ventures, after a competitive process and numerous offers received by leading global investment groups, we are in the final stage of negotiation on a none-binding term sheet for a minority JV interest in the portfolio of our existing assets."
1,"The services Primary supports and delivers are becoming increasingly important in this context. In Medical Centres, our new strategy should create a substantial shift in our proposition to put us at the forefront of our industry and peers. We aim to create a Workplace of Choice environment, creating a broader demographic of GP by providing them with an advanced digital platform to support their practices."
1,"The significant ramp in the size of Paramount's slate from 10 films in 2018, to 16 films in 2019 will drive incremental working capital consumption for the year, which we expect to more than offset the cash tax benefits from tax reform. Since we announced our strategic plan a year ago, including our commitment to reduce leverage and maintain investment grade metrics, we have made meaningful progress, reducing our gross debt by approximately $3 billion or 23%. During the quarter, we used our excess cash to redeem over $1 billion of senior notes and debentures."
1,"The Smart Touch selling tool automates and streamlines the ordering process, allowing our sales organization to drive incremental sales. Our modernization initiative demonstrates Farmer Brothers' commitment to providing best-in-class service, a pivotal part of our long-term growth strategy. When it comes to new business, our sales teams have initially focused on larger customer opportunities, these customers typically have a gestation period that can take six months or more from lead generation to contract signing and then a three to six month product transition window as the customer works through previous supplier inventory."
1,"The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was a hard-won victory for American businesses and workers, and for Altria, its employees and its shareholders. While we intend to return the majority of these tax savings to shareholders, we are also reinvesting behind important strategic initiatives like those we discussed today. To qualify for additional investment, these initiatives required a sound business case with key performance indicators and measurable outcomes, including sufficient financial returns or competitive benefit."
1,The team was able to deliver these impressive results despite having to overcome the November 2016 demonetization in India. Operating margins expanded nicely reflecting our strategy to add more ATMs in high-traffic locations. epay revenue grew 4%.
1,"The transaction brought to Briggs & Stratton premium stand-on commercial spreaders and spreader/sprayers for fertilizer and pesticide-herbicide lawn applications. The acquisition fits into our strategy to fill out the trailer of the commercial lawn and turf professional with highly regarded, innovative products that are built to stand up to the toughest working demands. We'll be able to apply our power application expertise and use our industry-leading global distribution network to accelerate growth of these high-quality products."
1,"The two companies each received shareholder approval on December 4 and we continue to be pleased with integration planning to this point and we remain on track for a first quarter close and a technology conversion in mid to late second quarter. As we move into 2018 and form the new First Financial Bank, we are excited about the scale and reach we will have to successfully execute our strategy, deliver exceptional service to clients and provide solid returns to shareholders. Finally, I want to take the opportunity to thank our associates for their efforts in 2017."
1,"The US EMV payment market normalization should come to an end in 2018, and the removable SIM market is expected to keep declining, while the next-generation connectivity usage grows slowly. If we move to slide 15, I would like to take the time to outline the contours of our strategy for the coming years. It's a strategy that focuses on our unique twin expertise in digital identity and data protection."
1,"The value of repeat testing with Signatera to monitor for treatment response and recurrence would be additional to that $5,000. We expect the results of our colon study with preliminary data being presented next month at AACR will form the basis for utility studies to launch when the CLIA test becomes available and will enable our reimbursement strategy, which is to apply for a unique CPT code with an ADLT distinction and to obtain coverage with data development at the time of launch. We plan to execute this strategy across multiple clinical indications and to deliver compelling evidence to drive changes in the NCCN practice guidelines."
1,"The vast majority of that is into the MiPlan product. The average case size has increased, our strategy, therefore, is to stay at the high-end of the market, and compete in that space, where I think we have advantages, remains focused, and we do see opportunity to increase share of wallet as we roll out our GIA and ISA oppositions and some of the spend that we will invest into the business later this year and into next year will be around improving our capability in that space. Over time, we may consider whether moving down the value chain towards the more mass affluent market makes sense."
1,"The year-over-year commodity driven gross margin compression should not be nearly as impactful as it was on our 2017 results, allowing us to get back to a more normalized EBITDA conversion of 12% to 15% in 2018 before growth investments. We will continue our investment strategy in new facilities and additional sales professionals in 2018, as well as startup investments in our operational excellence initiatives, combined totaling $10 million to $15 million incrementally. We are expecting 15% to 20% EBITDA growth in 2018."
1,"Their cash flow isn't as good right now. Ours were in much better shape because of our low debt level, but as we've said in the past, we have such good growth prospects that you know we're focused on delivering what we say we're going to do under our strategic plan, so we're going to keep doing that."
1,"Then just a second question. And Daryl, you kind of alluded to some strategic initiatives around used. I might be putting the cart before the horse here, but it does sound like there might be some change or shift in your thought process around the used business."
1,"Then you take a step back and you wrap around the broader Optum all of our data, analytics, our technology, our healthcare expertise, all of our resources and capital and put that together. We're incredibly excited and very much looking forward to joining forces with them and continuing to build out our strategy across the 75 markets we prioritize. And a lot of these assets and services are standalone and do a very good job even outside of those 75 markets, and you can think of them as connective tissue connecting the 75 markets that we've prioritized."
1,"There are certainly been times where the bond market is more attractive in the other direction. But to get that term, to get that 10-year term to continue to elongate and keep our average years to maturity above five, which is one of our objectives, I think, we're currently a little bit more than six. Being able to move the maturity after the end of the stack is strategically important to us."
1,"There are several internal drivers contributing to our performance supported by the benefit of tailwinds in many of the markets we serve. We've executed Phase I of Blueprint 2021, our three year strategic plan focused on building a better business model with stronger earnings power. Our strong market position, the relevancy of our products and our focused approach to serving customers better have all supported the successful execution of Phase I."
1,"There are some   there   there's always spending on   on high return projects that have   that impact our raw material utilization or our productivity, so really cost related investment. We have long-term plans at each ones of our mills, so the focus on those two   those two particular issues. And you know as we have the time and   and   and the capacity to implement those we will."
1,"There have been some acquisitions that we've been on the wrong side of, so I'm hoping that our luck changes on the acquisition side, because historically we've been generally pretty good on the acquisition side, that those acquisitions had been the other way. I've talked a couple times on the calls where there have been some smaller firms that don't really have very strategic plan going forward on TRUST or in wealth management that have gone to low-cost providers. We had a quirky one early this year, where a mid-size firm has decided to go more to a point-to-point versus an integrated solution, which was really unlike everybody else we're talking with."
1,"There I had full financial, operational and strategic responsibility for a number of the company's leading products in in vitro diagnostics and in technologies related to translational and personalized medicine. I was also very active in leading Olympus' search for merger and acquisition opportunities in Life Sciences and in the strategic planning for that business. Prior to my time with Olympus, I served as President and CEO and as a Board Member for Millennium Cell Inc."
1,"There is a lot of efficiency to be gained. And so, making sure that as the cost of storage comes down, the cost of processing comes down, how do we reallocate those benefits into our digital strategy, and that's precisely what we're doing. The other thing is, is there is a heritage of cost control and really disciplined capital allocation that make sure that every dollar that we spend on technology is going to be a good productive one."
1,"There is a, contractually a two year lock-up that you know and that's in place. What I can assure you is that I run a strong independent company with a focus on executing our strategy for the benefit of our customers and all of our shareholders. The synergies remain on track at $700 million for 2018."
1,"There was a dramatic change on the Net Ease score for finding income on your account and understand the income on your account from close to 0% to over 50%. What I'm saying is that clients want good service, and that's the DNA of our strategy. It means that we retain existing clients and welcome new clients from competitors."
1,"There was about AUD 300,000 benefit from further early settlement activities associated with the premium payback liability. And the increase in MER is reflective of investment in strategic initiatives. World Nomads, Mark touched on earlier, delivered a strong result with UOP of AUD 4."
1,"There, what I would call, there's some basic leveling exercise, here some groundwork that needs to be done to take advantage of what I see is intermediate opportunities here. So, we're looking at those strategic initiatives, but we're sort of setting the table, I guess, the way I would phrase it, that we're setting the tables so that the next CEO that buys into this program and is aligned with our board's vision here can take advantage of the groundwork. I think we just simply don't want to have an interruption of the progress we're going to make in the next two to three to four months on this."
1,"There'll be small changes like that. But I don't want you to expect any big declaration of, here's our new strategy in fiber cement Europe before about two years. We got some platform, R&D development work to do."
1,"There's a lot of loyalty amongst patients and we've started to cultivate loyalty with providers. As I noted, while our primary go-to-market strategy is to focus on patients, the Medicare competitive bidding cuts have put pressure on the providers, such that delivering tanks is simply unsustainable. They've looked at Inogen as the leader in this space to help them transition their model from a delivery model to a non-delivery one."
1,"There's more to come as we have focused on improving our returns, and we'll do this partly by doing more of the same as you've seen given supportive marketplace and sound capital, but we're also intending to invest in innovation and renewal. So, we have renewed our five-year business plan to invest in strategic priorities. This includes digitizing the group to help us deliver market leading customer experience and to drive operational savings as well."
1,"There's no doubt that we've had pressure from gross profits from supplier consolidations. However, with our four pillar strategy that I laid out earlier in the call, we believe that's going to position us well, getting more of our business digitally-focused, which is not just e-commerce, but it also is digitizing our own business so we can take more OpEx out, rightsizing the company, and maximizing usage of the ecosystem as well the transformation project that's well underway. Let me speak to that for just a moment."
1,"There's the national grocers that are downsizing. Fitness is also an area that we're looking at because it's about the right-size box, it generates a lot of traffic, it's not a competing business; and by the way, it fits really well into our active and wellness strategy. So there's plenty of candidates that is going to be, I think, zero issue for us."
1,"These applications are all engineered-to-order applications, focused on again severe service, high viscosity types of applications, high pressures, contamination, multiphase types of applications. So, it fits our strategy very well, common end markets but does diversify us pretty significantly from a technology standpoint and gets us more into aftermarket, which I'll talk more about here in a second. I want to talk about the acquisition in more detail."
1,"These are examples how we want to work with our customers, how we add value to them, how we benefit as a result of that. This is what our strategy is all about. So, in summary, we have a good order book, good maintenance base, so our sales growth is continuing."
1,"These are exciting extensions to an already extremely strong portfolio. From a package perspective and in support of our long-term strategy, we continue to focus on driving more convenience packaging, such as small cans, more premium packaging, like small glass bottles. Our Revenue Growth Management strategy is working and has supported solid price per case realization in 2017."
1,"These are just some of the accomplishments in 2017 and while we are proud of these achievements, there is room for improvement. We continue to believe there is opportunity to create significant stockholder value as we execute on our strategic initiatives, which includes returning our operating margin to historical levels. We continue to believe we're in a prolific environment across our end markets in the U."
1,These assets become more important when you consider how the transaction with WBA will benefit our organization. The new Rite Aid will be financially stronger with lower debt and more financial flexibility to invest in strategic initiatives that drive our business. We will have a more profitable store network with a higher percentage of wellness stores.
1,"These challenges included multiple hurricanes and impacted several of our facilities and weaker market conditions in our storage business. In the face of these challenges, our teams remain focused on executing on our strategy and business plan. This helped us finish the year with a distribution coverage ratio of 1."
1,"These duties are 14%, that applies on our products, a barrier, a stable barrier and there is absolutely no doubt that today we'll see. And the second point is that our strategy in Brazil has always been the same, strengthen the competitiveness of Brazil, continue to cancel all the effect of inflation and continue to work on the competitiveness of Brazil. Knowing that the potential of the consumption per capital is still there, it is one of the region which has the lowest level of consumption of per capita and we have a position which is extremely good in terms of logistic as Brazil is an extremely complex country for the logistic."
1,"These increases were partly offset by the short-term negative impact from FY 2018 new center openings. Our strategy to accelerate the rollout of new dental centers in the past few years has had a net dilutive impact on the margin in the short-term. There were five new centers opened in the first half 2018, which reduced EBITDA by AUD 0."
1,"These incremental recurring offerings, such as data feed connectors, will further support the growth of our recurring revenue going forward. The fourth key component of our strategic plan involves leadership. We have made significant changes to our leadership team as we move to the next stage of growth for the company; in this case, growing from $500 million to over $1 billion in sales."
1,"These projects give solid line of sight to growing margins in the second half of this year. Here, we spent greater than halfway into our DCP 2020 journey and we are well ahead of schedule in transforming our culture, our operations and our financial strategy. Towards the end of this presentation, I'm excited to share with you what we've been working on over the past year, it's what we call DCP 2."
1,"These screens also position us for significant revenue growth in the future in both New York and other urban markets. Two other strategic initiatives are now generating revenues, OUTFRONT Mobile and cellular leasing revenues. While still less than $10 million combined, together they were up over 75% in 2017 and will continue to grow."
1,"These strategies remain the same from last year and are focused on organic expansion in our core growth areas, areas where we have enhanced execution and strong project returns. Our first growth strategy is to maximize our strategic position in Oklahoma. 2017 was a very active year for us on the execution front in Oklahoma."
1,"These transactions will further enhance our ability to continue to improve our operating metrics. More importantly, as I mentioned earlier, we were happy to be able to execute our strategic plan in an effort to grow our company. Our board and management team couldn't be more pleased with the direction of our company."
1,"They are framed by a very, very clear mechanism for prioritization. I mentioned earlier it starts with growing LinkedIn and accelerating the realization of our objectives. But it's really three components and they're interrelated."
1,"They are spending about $120 billion in five years, at a rate this is at a rate of about $30 billion, $24 billion, $25 billion a year. Kuwait announced their strategic plan. They're also doing more to increase their production capacity."
1,"They can connect with their existing products, existing solution. And that's what we call our strategy for the next 10 years, I will say, is security operation center enabler. Trend Micro is not trying to be or we don't want to become the security operation center, but our product, our technology will enable all the security operation center to provide their customer even better solution."
1,"They make a decision on that and would talk to us at that point in time. And when you look at the free cash flow that we're generating, you'll see us pay down our debt this year and next year and get ourselves positioned there, where if that was something that they wanted to do, we'd be well positioned to be able to do it and still have flexibility to continue to grow our business and drive our strategic priorities that we've outlined."
1,"They want simpler products with greater convenience and ease. The strategic plan we are presenting today aims to provide a proactive response to the opportunities created by these changes. So, let me briefly outline how our four strategic priorities will enhance our existing strengths and transform the group for success in a digital world."
1,"They're generating extremely high margins per day. We've got extremely satisfied customers, and it just is meeting all of our objectives and KPIs as we've ever hoped for. Even though we generated pretty good margins in the fourth quarter, we're guiding up a little bit higher for Q1."
1,"They're growing very fast, and we're actually   exceeded our own expectations again this quarter in terms of the growth we're seeing in our solutions in the public cloud. We'll probably say more about overall our public cloud strategy, the solutions we have in there, and the traction we're seeing in the public cloud at our Analyst Meeting in March, Paul."
1,"Third goal is profitable growth and we have a number of initiatives, which I won't go through here all around driving growth faster in the market. Then in financial performance, it's what I would call affectionately the big four strategic initiatives. That's simplification, lean enterprise, strategic supply chain and value pricing."
1,"Third, I will comment on our experience welcoming our two recent acquisitions, taskforce AG and Accretive Solutions, into RGP and outline further plans for integration. Fourth, I will report on our progress against our strategic initiatives. To remind you, they're sales transformation, operating model improvement, and cost containment."
1,"Third, we grew our sales in China by 26% as we continue to benefit from the construction and ramp of a number of new fabs for both leading edge and mainstream applications. To support our China strategy and drive future growth, we entered into two relationships with local partners, Spectrum and Jingxing, to increase our capacity and reduce lead times for certain specialty gases and deposition materials. Chinese customer qualifications for these products are underway and we expect these partnerships to contribute to our growth in 2018."
1,"Third, we're aware our business continues to outperform our long-term outlook of 4% to 6% revenue growth. We continue to work internally on our annual update to our strategic plan and assessing the future impact of the Cook Pharmica acquisition on our long-term growth targets. Next, I'm confident that Wetteny Joseph will flourish in his new role as our CFO, building on a strong foundation established by Matt Walsh and his team."
1,"Thirdly, with regard to the leverage, I don't think we can comment on any particular target leverage. And more importantly, until we finalize the strategic plan discussions, any leverage target would be meaningless. But once again, as the Chairman said, we are committed to make efficient use of the capital and not to, let's say, run the business on equity only."
1,"This 5-year agreement, which is renewable for an additional 10 years, is indicative of the value, customers are placing on our business model. Our focused supplier strategy continues to contribute to improve profitability in the UPS business, while at the same time supporting our partners as they drive to meet their growth goals. Importantly, we believe we have created a platform to further expand this business, opportunities including selling a broader set of solutions, including security through existing customers, winning businesses with new customers, and winning business that had previously been manufacturing direct."
1,"This acquisition will also meet key financial metrics, including contributing to the reshaping of our portfolio by adding over $80 million in annual ATS revenue to Celestica and delivering attractive acquisition economics. As we have highlighted in our diversification strategy, we plan to continue to evaluate acquisitions to increase our presence in these diversified markets, build our management team expertise and expand our capabilities. Over the past year, we have engaged with a number of companies and continue to remain prudent in assuring strategic fit and long-term value creation for our shareholders."
1,"This advertising product scales our platform beautifully, and gets more agents using our technology to prospect for and service their clients, as well as complete more real estate transactions. We are applying the same strategic priorities in moving down funnel and evolving our revenue models to grow our emerging marketplaces as well. Most notably, we're expanding elements of our Concierge service to our Rentals, Mortgages and New Construction marketplaces."
1,"This allows both our customers and our shareholders to benefit from the implementation of our aggressive energy efficiency programs, and not be hurt by them, financially. Moving from our strategic initiatives, we also achieved significant operational, financial and regulatory successes over the past 12 months. We are working with regulators in each of the states that we serve to identify the investments needed to modernize the electric grid and improve its capabilities and resiliency."
1,"This allows us to continue to be highly selective and ensures that we're only working with brokers and insurers who truly are a fit and have demonstrated the capability and willingness to be a long-term partner. With regard to our claims strategy, we will maintain our proven strategy of settling claims promptly and fairly. We remain committed to providing best-in-class, personalized claims service even as our customer base expands."
1,"This also reflects the continued investments necessary to scale up our Home Systems business where we see a very large market opportunities in the coming years. In Lamps, finally, the performance reflects the successful implementation of our last man standing strategy to continue to extract value from the conventional business. This supports our objective to maintain an adjusted EBITA margin of at least 16% until 2019."
1,"This BlueField-based solutions represent investment made during 2017 which allow Mellanox access to a $2 billion TAM opportunity. Beginning in May 2017, in an effort to ensure Mellanox continues to allocate capital as efficiently as possible, we began a comprehensive cost review process and review of our strategic priorities and investments. This review involved a portfolio rationalization process including seizing investments in a new generation of the network processing unit, the NPS product family."
1,"This call contains projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events, our future financial performance and potential financing sources. All statements other than present and historical facts and conditions discussed in this call, including any statements regarding our future results of operations and financial positions, business strategy and plans, expectations for IoT and broadband sales, sources of funding and our objectives for future operations are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements are only predictions and reflect our current beliefs and expectations with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties and subject to change at any time."
1,"This capped in well for some sureties. Obviously, it's not our long-term plan to shrink to greatness, but we support our underwriters when they determine it's better to sit out the game until order is reestablished. We will continue to remain stalwart and steadfast in our underwriting discipline, maintaining a consistent appetite and stay focused on what we can control, adding value by investing in people, service and technology that differentiate us for the future."
1,"This center is clearly the best in the trade area as evidenced by the high shop rents and continued high occupancy. Mac, will now take us through the components of our Fresh Look strategy and demonstrate the finer aspects of executing our merchandise strategy."
1,"This change did not result in a higher total bonus to employees, just in how we record these bonus expense. Second, in the quarter, we increased the incentive compensation pool to recognize the achievement of key milestones involving several important strategic initiatives, as well as the hiring of key executives. And lastly, because of the tax reform rules, we accelerated the vesting of certain stock awards originally scheduled to vest in January in order for the company to maximize the tax deductibility of the award."
1,"This contributed to a significant increase in free cash flow in the quarter to CAD 83 million from CAD 34 million in the prior year along with improvements in working capital. We are pleased with the disciplined progress we have made on our financial priorities to-date, which will enable us to continue making the right investments in support of our long-term strategic priorities. I'll now turn the call back over to Doug for his closing comments."
1,"This demonstrates that we have a very broad portfolio to address the entire market and are moving up the value chain. All investments here again are covered within our budget and strategic planning enhanced, for example, into the CapEx and adjusted EBITDA. Which leads me to the last aspect of the strategic development, which I hope I have already hammered, which is that we have clear capital deployment principle and expectations."
1,"This does mark an important inflection point for the group with a significant change in gear in the transformation of our bank. As you know, the last two strategic plans have focused on the recovery of the group's financial strength and on restoring our customer focus. But both AntÃ³nio and I have repeatedly said that we could not be complacent."
1,"This enabled us to offset significantly higher average recovered fiber cost and other input cost headwinds, such as transportation to grow our margins and deliver solid earnings and free cash flow in 2017. Moving to slide 7, International Paper continues to be a strong and sustainable cash generator, which enables us to execute our strategy and optimize capital allocation to continue growing value for our shareholders. On slide 8, International Paper delivered another strong year of return on invested capital with a 300-basis-point spread to our weighted average cost of capital."
1,"This geographic tuck-in transaction marks the ninth acquisition since April of 2016. As communicated in our strategy, we're focused on tuck-in organic-like-inorganic growth by expanding our service footprint and product offerings through acquisition. Pure Water Solutions is yet another example of this successful strategy."
1,"This gives UCT a significant competitive advantage. That's why the most important part of our strategy is to expand our critical content on existing and new customer platforms organically and inorganically. As part of this strategy, we recently completed a $100 million financing to help to fund our future growth and market expansion."
1,"This gives us the opportunity to fuel our growth and facilitate our capture of new clients. Turning to our third strategic initiative of grow Digital Commerce. Our Digital Commerce segment grew significantly in the year, driven by our Ecommerce business and the stabilization of our Software business."
1,"This has been and will continue to be a priority for us. The careful prioritization of our objectives has been fundamental to our success. In 2017, we ensured that three of our four distribution centers were relocated prior to our busiest quarters, Q3 and Q4."
1,"This has given us the opportunity to grow our business with consumers, licensors, and retailers and we are leveraging our success into an expanding assortment of products and distribution footprint. This is our growth strategy and we believe we are very well positioned to execute our strategic initiatives to continue developing and growing our business. From a content perspective, we are expanding into number of properties in our portfolio and continuing to drive fan engagement and consumer demand through use of social media and digital video."
1,"This improvement, when combined with the more favorable year-over-year effective tax rate and a reduction in shares outstanding, led to a 9% increase in our currency neutral adjusted EPS. We also continue to advance our long-term strategy that will enable us to deliver strong returns for our shareholders. Some key highlights."
1,"This included 110 basis points of higher commodity costs, reflecting the hurricane-related pressures we discussed last quarter as well as 90 basis points of higher logistics costs, driven in part by a further tightening of the transportation market. Importantly, consistent with our strategy, we invested about $8 million or 60 basis points in future growth and cost savings programs. Second quarter gross margin also includes a benefit of 170 basis points from the strong cost savings."
1,"This includes a plan to develop a platform which will provide a complete view of each of our customers. Our data strategy will allow our bankers and product specialists to collaborate more easily and improve our level of customer service, and ultimately, drive us towards our long-term balance sheet and revenue growth objectives. We're also making great strides in our Clicks-to-Bricks strategy that I mentioned earlier in the call."
1,"This is a testament to our approach to risk management and hedging. Moving to slide 14, let's discuss our credit strategy. Our unique portfolio of deeply discounted legacy non-Agency RMBS is a distinguishing feature of our strategy because of the total return opportunities that exist."
1,"This is actually Chris Speros on for Gur. Can you talk about the drivers of the success you've seen in your land and expand strategy? Specifically, are multi-product customers primarily Cloud Agent customers that have deployed multiple agent products?"
1,"This is another area we're partnering with local MROs will provide opportunities in the Asian market. In summary, we continue with our strategy to focus on the sales and marketing aspects of our current and newly developed product as a key to creating value for our shareholders. Let me turn the call back to Geoff with some closing remarks."
1,"This is Brent. I mean I think we've   in 2017, we've had a lot, lot going on as, you know, with DOL, lots of strategic initiatives in the broker-dealer and such. And I think those will continue on into 2018 expenses."
1,"This is especially true for Asia-Pacific region plus 39%. And in 2017, it has to say that the American and Asian platforms of the CIB contribute to the tune of 38%, I think to the overall income, which is the great results and is very much in line with our strategy, our new board of strategy. Developments in M&A was another part of a new frontier plan which explains the buoyancy of these results."
1,This is happening at both large scale and smaller airports. Here's just a few examples of the North American airports that announced long-term plans to add or expand existing terminals just this past year. Chicago O'Hare International Airport announced an $8.
1,"This is one-time. And I believe this is a good redesign of our balance sheet to allocate future capital allocations to fuel our 2022 growth strategy. If I now move on to the P&L and the detailed P&L, so you can see here on the first line that our recurring EBITDA at real scope in rate has increased by CHF 40 million."
1,"This is our total spend in one year. And quite frankly, our total investment in IT, particularly on the front office side, will also depend on the success of our strategy. And here, you can basically look at two parts now."
1,"This is quite meaningful to us considering that 60% of our acreage is prospective for the Wolfcamp D, so we're looking forward to further results in there. Moving now to slide 15, as we progress on our long-term development strategy, it's time for us to come to the same level of understanding on developing the Spraberry intervals as we have in the Wolfcamp. As a part of our 2018 program, we're going to execute three pads and 19 wells where we're going to be testing various stacking, spacing, sequencing, and completion variables between the Middle Spraberry Shale, the Jo Mill, and Lower Spraberry Shale."
1,"This means that we've grown our dividend for six consecutive years. The growing dividends are well funded by the remittances from our business units, while also allowing for investments in strategic priorities and new business. During the year, our operating units generated approximately â‚¬1."
1,"This move improved efficiency and helped reduce operating losses in line with expectations. Our objectives of moving this project towards the breakeven level exiting our Q4 remains unchanged. For the March quarter, we are guiding CTG revenue to be up 5% to 10% year-over-year, benefiting from the expansion of new programs and realizing normal seasonality with consumer products."
1,"This not only supports our direct distribution strategy, but also lowers the cost of servicing customers after they have purchased their ticket. As we execute our direct distribution strategy, it is critical that we invest in these digital tools and look for further opportunities with our business partners. Turning to slide 14, we are approaching an important inflection point in our CASM ex-fuel growth trends in 2018."
1,"This paragraph emphasizes the major uncertainties and risks inherent in the forward-looking statements we will make this afternoon. Please keep these uncertainties and risks in mind as we discuss future strategic initiatives, potential market opportunities, operational outlook, and financial guidance during today's call. Today's call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, as that term is defined in Regulation G."
1,"This plan of course also has implicit, NPE reduction program, implicit in the budget and so on. Having said that, we are always acting and planning further, and we will prepare further I would say more action and more plans which part of our day to day process to re-plan and also to act, so we will probably until the end of March do a new re-planning, a more detailed planning of both our long-term plan and our NPE reduction plan. So but this is part outside the management."
1,"This portfolio strategy for RRP will be introduced first in Japan ahead of other markets where the group is operating. Of course, for this strategy to work, we will make sure two things happen, Ploom TECH needs to succeed, and we need to gain SoM from competitors by entering the heated tobacco category. Regarding low-temperature type Ploom TECH, we will emphasize the benefits unique to heating such as reduced influence to the surroundings and creation of opportunities to enjoy tobacco products."
1,"This quarter, I'm going to intentionally keep my comments brief, so you can hear more from these gentlemen. They will go through the numbers, the progress in our businesses and our strategic initiatives. After an almost two-year quiet and seemingly uninterrupted march higher in the financial markets, we all know too well that a lot has recently changed."
1,This relatively low level of participation reflects the fact that our hedge book is highly effective at current fuel prices. FY 2019 hedging is also underway consistent with our long-held hedging strategy. We currently have 50% of our exposure hedged with high levels of participation to falling fuel prices.
1,"This represents an increase of 23%, our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. This performance reflects solid core revenue growth, execution on margin-expansion initiatives, investment in strategic initiatives to drive future growth, and a $0. 06 benefit related to U."
1,"This resulting mix improvement, along with price increases realized in our basics portfolio were the key drivers of the quarterly EBITDA improvement, as well as our EBITDA margin increasing 370 basis points. Our strong EBITDA performance also reflects the successful transformation of our Leverkusen, Germany operations as part of our larger strategic initiative focused on asset optimization and downstream specialties. Looking at the full year 2017, revenues were up 1% as a result of strong growth within our specialties portfolio, more than offsetting an intentional reduction in our basic products."
1,"This segment so has many benefits closer to the customer, lower capital intensity, but huge growth potential. We have made our strategy simple. We have four value drivers, how we run the company from now on."
1,"This should take around say 15 minutes and then we'll have 45 minutes for your questions and we aim to finish by mid-day. So 2017 was the second year of our three-year strategic plan and we've continued to help our customers at the moment that matter most to them, providing an excellent service in products that make a real difference to their lives. We have delivered on our promises to our shareholders meeting the majority of our customer target and reporting a strong financial performance against the backdrop of a difficult external environment."
1,"This site-less approach improves the speed and lowers the cost of studies, and we expect to expand this highly-attractive offering in 2018. Our third strategic initiative is to develop a broad platform to deepen our consumer relationships. We have made strong progress improving the user experience of our services and continue to roll out new tools and technology, including LabCorp Express, LabCorp PreCheck and LabCorp Patient."
1,"This speaks volumes to the similar cultures and the visions of our two organizations. Expanding our footprint and expertise in this high-growth area of healthcare helps to accelerate our strategy. In Virginia, we continue to work on an implementation plan for the Medallion 4."
1,"This starts with endeavoring to make enhancements to Regency's strategy, refinements to that strategy even though it is proven and battle-tested so that our strategy will be even more relevant. By consistently executing on that strategy day in and day out, we'll achieve our objectives which are, first of all, sustaining same property NOI growth of 3-plus percent or more and it ranks at or near the top of the shopping center sector; from our premier portfolio, from intense asset management, from implementing our Fresh Look merchandising and placemaking philosophy, and from astute capital allocation. Second, to start and deliver $300 million in developments and redevelopments of premier shopping centers to grow NAV and fortify NOI."
1,"This strong performance drove a record year for the company in terms of revenue and adjusted EBITDA generation. As we look forward, our objectives for the next few years will be a continuation of the strong progress we made during 2017 to improve the financial attributes of our company. We begin 2018 with our priorities well-defined, with a focus on further simplified operating model, strong execution, and operational excellence, all of which we believe will create a more scalable organization with significantly improved free cash flow generation."
1,"This transaction will enable us to continue to effectively leverage those investments. In summary, we have a successful history of generating shareholder value through effectively executing on our M&A strategy. With each deal we have done, our process for integrating the team, converting the systems and client base has and will continue to improve."
1,"This was a unique win for Q2 because this institution is the chartered retail bank of a national brokerage and wealth management firm. The firm is looking to aggressively grow their retail banking assets and selected Q2's platform for this strategic initiative. While this customer is the first of its kind for Q2, we believe it represents a new opportunity and an expansion of the market for Q2, as other investment firms across the country look to increase their investment in their retail banking channels."
1,"This was not a decision that we took lightly, but as we addressed in previous calls, the state of the rail OEM market, which is our primary coatings end market, remains under significant pressure after several years, and it's demonstrated minimal signs of meaningful recovery. Through the lens of our strategic plan, we took a fresh look at our future opportunities for the Coatings business and concluded that it does not meet our profitability expectations and would, therefore, be better served with another strategic owner that is more diversely exposed in the specialty coatings end markets. Along with this action, we took a onetime non-cash charge, which was sizable enough such that we do not expect any further write-downs of this business."
1,"This was obviously a very productive quarter for us and we are pleased to continue to generate growth both organically and through the launch of new innovative programs with exciting new partnerships. Before I pass the call over to Brian to give details on our financial results for the quarter and our outlook for 2018, I'd like to provide a recap of the substantial progress we made on our strategic priorities in 2017. Growing our business remains a top priority and, in 2017, we achieved this through organic growth, new deals, and the renewal of several key partnerships."
1,"This was primarily caused by the PET downsizing in Russia, which I will come back to later in today's presentation. Slide 4 please, and a brief update on our strategic initiatives. Our two group priorities for 2017 were, firstly to execute on Funding the Journey in order to create sufficient financial headroom, and secondly to invest in our SAIL'22 priorities to drive sustainable long-term top and bottom line growth."
1,"This will be driven by continuing growth in Web Brand Networks combined with high-single-digit year-over-year growth in Premium Services that accelerates throughout the year. Moving to our strategy. As technology has evolved, so have the needs of small businesses."
1,"This will obviously going to gather pace and as that happens we will see the benefit of reduction in cost of goods flow through to our margins. These are our objectives that by the end of next fiscal we will have backward integrated roughly half of our Australia portfolio. So, let me turn now to the emerging and institutional emerging markets and institutional business where you will see that we have dropped in quarter three, which is mainly due to the timing of orders of the institutional malaria business I'll come to it in a minute."
1,"This win will make a meaningful incremental contribution to revenues in 2018. Consistent with my commentary on prior earnings calls, earlier in 2017 we added capacity to support this new business opportunity and because we own the IP with this module, we can go after new customers and applications, consistent with our strategy to expand our customer base in our served markets. It is our expectation that the liquid delivery product offering will help us achieve increased business beyond our two largest customers."
1,"This, combined with ongoing debt repayments, will effectively reduce gross debt. Also, we will continue with our normal course issuer bid and we will look at other uses of cash as our strategic plan matures. Over the last several years, our capital expenditure program has been directed primarily at fleet and product investment."
1,Those can be higher or lower in any given quarter or year. A key part of our consumer strategy is to grow products that generate more fee income. That's important for our customer value proposition and also helps drive returns higher over time.
1,"Those other equipment manufacturers their primary sales go to the provider community. And I know when we've switched our strategy, we had some provider customers that were unhappy with us. They felt that we had crossed the line and that we were competing with them and they didn't want to buy from us anymore."
1,"Though no longer on national media, we continue to promote Pretzel Twist on our pop screens at the drive-in. Operational simplicity is another critical strategic initiative that we're employing, and we're using it as a filter as we assess potential product innovation. Note that neither of these products require significant incremental SKUs, and they are both relatively easy to execute in the drive-ins."
1,"Through our cash flow generation and EBITDA growth, we also anticipate $650 million of available capital to deploy, in line with the prudent philosophy Jeremy outlined. Over the long-term, we do intend for our growth strategy to include acquiring product lines with similar characteristics to the six products in our aggressive investment category. The underlying elements of the operational excellence initiatives that we have described today are also intended to build the organizational capabilities to assess, select and integrate potential acquisitions."
1,"Tiger will provide a high-level overview of our results, and update you on some of our strategic initiatives; and Ed will then discuss our financial performance in greater detail and provide our outlook for 2018; Tiger will then come back for some closing comments and then we will take your questions. As Carmen just mentioned, we expect the call to last about an hour."
1,"To be clear, even when an organization is working with a sense of urgency and clearly-defined strategic goals, turnarounds take time. We anticipate a multi-year process to implement the changes that we've outlined in our strategic plan. We look forward to keeping you updated of our progress on our upcoming calls."
1,"To be clear, we remain strategically committed to growing our self-serve national and partner sales channels, and we expect to capture an increasing proportion of our opportunity via these avenues in coming years. At the same time, the effectiveness and economics of our core local Sales Rep model are compelling, and we view our multichannel strategy as a competitive advantage that is an \\""and\\"" question rather than an \\""either/or\\"". Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $41."
1,"To be honest with you, during my tenure, it's taken about half of it to work off what was the existing when I came in through the commitments and the long lead time on exploration. So, as we've said to market, really, the next couple of years going to tell for us as to whether our exploration strategy has worked or not. But as you can see, it's a part of our growth."
1,"To conclude, we're pleased with the core earnings performance in the first quarter of 2018. We're also confident that our transformation plan and the strategic initiatives that we are implementing will lead to sustainable profitability and create long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you for your attention."
1,"To give some context for this change, at the time C-III acquired RSO's manager, the annualized RSO management fee was greater than $13 million a year, and at September 30, 2017, the annual run rate fee was equal to approximately $11 million a year. In light of the significant incremental resources that have been required to execute the strategic plan and reestablish RSO's origination and asset management functions, the board agreed that it was reasonable for compensation to the new manager to be fixed at this level through December 2018, as the strategic plan is executed and finalized and incremental resources are acquired. Now, I would like to discuss the changes to the incentive management fee calculation."
1,"To help this effort, we recently took steps to align our organization in a way that maximizes the value of our assets from a cash margin and VCI perspective, while ensuring that teams are working collaboratively, leads safely and creatively to achieve operational goals. In summary, with our strategic plan in place, CRC is rooted in creating and delivering sustainable value to shareholders while maintaining our commitment to invest within cash flow and prioritize value-driven growth in 2018 and beyond. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark."
1,"To help us effectively design and implement the Monro forward program, we've hired a third-party, a firm which I've had great success with in the past. From a timing perspective, we expect our updated tire merchandising strategy will be implemented by the middle of fiscal 2019. With respect to our store refresh, in-store procedures and employee sales training, we've already begun the first phase, the design and planning process, which we expect will also be completed by the middle of fiscal 2019, at which point, we will begin a pilot across three select markets."
1,"To maintain this momentum and increase share of the household wallet, we will continue to focus on growing subscribers and cross-selling products and services to them. Looking at our strategic priorities for the remainder of the 2018 financial year on slide 17. These priorities remain unchanged and are to continue to develop and leverage our technology platforms, increase subscriber growth and grow share of the customer wallet."
1,"To propel our strategy and position our business for the future, we announced two large strategic acquisitions this past year. First, consistent with our strategy to expand across the continuum of care, we announced that we acquired Byram Healthcare, the second largest direct-to-patient services company in the U. S."
1,"To recap, we started seeing some improvement on the top line rate of decline through the second half of 2017 and based on what we're currently seeing 2018 top line trends should be similar to the fourth quarter of 2017. While we have conviction that our strategic initiatives will be effective, we remain prudent in our capital allocation. We're already seeing progress along our tech-focused strategy and we're keenly focused on preserving profitability."
1,"To reiterate, fiscal third quarter marks some important developments. We've been proactive in pursuing our objectives of enhancing our returns and strengthening our company. Our continuing operations are performing well and our team is working tirelessly to maximize our competitive positioning, to provide best-in-class innovative products to our customers, and to drive total shareholder return."
1,"To reiterate, the outlook for advisory business is positive, as evidenced by the improving flows into our European SICAV products and the growing pipeline of unfunded mandates across our full range of investment strategies and geographic regions. The subadvisory channel, excluding Japan, experienced modest net inflows of $63 million in the quarter, which were largely into our global real estate strategy. An important strategic win in the quarter was a real asset debt portfolio, which represents an exciting new opportunity for our fixed income team through a Japanese open-end fund that will launch early this year."
1,"To sum it up, we delivered significantly improved financial performance in 2017 as market conditions began to strengthen in our regions. The operational efficiencies implemented across the organization, cost discipline and the strong execution of our strategic priorities have enabled us to generate a higher return on invested capital and solid free cash flow. Looking ahead, we are focused on generating earnings leverage while investing in growth opportunities and long-term strategic initiatives to transform our customer experience."
1,"To summarize, following a year in which we delivered strong results, we began 2018 well-positioned to execute on our growth strategy. Thanks for joining us this morning and we look forward to reporting our results to you again next quarter."
1,"To summarize, Q2 was a strong quarter with solid top-line growth, strong profitability, cash flows and order growth. We continue to make solid progress on our strategic priorities, making key investments to drive our long-term growth. Let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018."
1,"To support these efforts, we are focused on attracting, retaining, and developing top talent throughout the organization. Over this past year, we've attracted new talent to our senior management team and recently made another key hire to support our strategic plan. In mid-February, Tim Mantel joined the company as Chief Merchant and will be responsible for overseeing all of the company's merchandising initiatives."
1,"To that end, in 2017, we reduced consolidated operating expenses by 37% as compared to 2016. As we continue to deliver on our strategic initiatives, we will continue to focus on reducing operating expenses by evaluating them to ensure that our operations remain as cost effective, while still maintaining a high level of performance. Lastly, Syncora continues to hold a significant amount of net operating losses or NOLs and we continue to review the merits of different businesses to potentially utilize this asset."
1,"To that end, on October 5, Kermit Crawford officially joined our team as President and Chief Operating Officer of Rite Aid Corporation. In just a few months, Kermit's knowledge, passion and commitment to innovation are having a positive impact on our team as we work together to deliver against our strategic priorities. So at this time, I'd like to introduce Kermit to provide more details about our strategic priorities moving forward and an update on our key initiatives."
1,"To that end, we recently announced an interactive modeling section of our website that allows analysts and investors to easily download our historical financial statements to assist in the creation of financial models on the company. We are looking forward to our upcoming plans to get out on the road more with investors to communicate our strategy and the attractiveness of an investment in Ashford Trust. I'll now turn the call over to Deric to review our fourth quarter financial performance."
1,"To the degree, these programs perform well and justify the investment, we'll continue to add them to more stores and share the results with our Wholesale customer base. We're also continuing work on our e-commerce strategy that includes home delivery, click and collect and creative digital campaigns. Early in the quarter, we expanded our outreach to additional stores as part of a multi-year agreement signed with Instacart."
1,"To your third question, Trackside, yes, we believe we'll get the regulatory approvals to roll that product into Queensland. That's an important strategic initiative. It's something that's going to be very valuable for retailers, generate income for the --for retail and racing."
1,"Today, I would like to talk about our strategic success in terms of both customer acceptance as well as our team coming together with a single focus to ensure that our strategy wins. On the customer front, we continue to see strong receptivity to our strategy and offerings. Our customers are happy to see Teradata demonstrate flexibility in deployment options, whether on-prem, in the cloud or a combination."
1,"Today, the platform successfully manages all distribution for Choice Hotels, optimizing rate, inventory, availability, shopping, booking, and reservations for its website, mobile apps, call centers, and third-party distribution partners. In summary, our 2017 results prove that our strategy is working. As we build on our foundation, we are committed to growth."
1,"Today, we will recap the fourth quarter and the full-year performance of our legacy companies and provide insight into how we see the market unfolding in 2018. I would also like to share my thoughts on the strategic priorities for Nutrien, our financial guidance for the year, and additional details on our synergy targets. I'm excited for the future of Nutrien."
1,"Today, we will review the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 performance, discuss the company's possible growth path, comment on some of the current market and regional trends and the related strategic actions we are taking and introduce our outlook for the full-year 2018. We generated favorable results for our fiscal year 2017 that demonstrate the progress we have made on our strategy to position Shiloh as a technology leader with the ability to deliver more profitable and value-added products. Our margin performance highlights this progress."
1,"Today, with on-demand beauty applications and the development of e-commerce, consumers are expecting to find product and services everywhere at any time. This has led us to redefine our strategy. Our aim is to take the professional market one step ahead, making optimal use of our incredible assets, salons and professional expertise."
1,"Today's agreement strengthens one of our three global businesses, and will support overall performance and capital planning for the group. Last year, I laid out my strategic priorities   innovation, performance and trust, and our capital allocation framework. This transaction that we've announced today is consistent with both those priorities and this framework."
1,"Today's quarterly results see the business tracking in line to achieve full year guidance on production and on cost. Essentially, all it says is that we are doing exactly what we said we will do, both on the operational front and in respect to our organic growth strategy. At the halfway mark of the financial year, we are comfortably on-track to meet our production and cost guidance for the 12 months."
1,"Total China retail is a RMB 33 trillion economy, well, merely 20% of it is online. Our New Retail strategy will enable us to tap into the 80% of the retail consumption that remain offline in China. We believe we have the technology advantage and proprietary know-how to execute the New Retail strategy at large scale."
1,"Turning to our Power and High-Rel Product Group, in Q4 of fiscal year 2018, our Power and High-Reliability Product Group delivered its third consecutive quarter of sequential growth and increased 5% sequentially and represented 9% of total net revenues. As part of the company's ongoing review of its strategic initiatives, I determine that the value of our Power and High-Rel Product Group could be better leveraged by redirecting and focusing its efforts on supporting the exploding number of new initiatives and use cases associated with our LoRa related ecosystem. These initiatives are broad reaching and include opportunities in sensing, energy harvesting and rechargeable LoRa tags."
1,Turning to risk management. Maintaining a strong risk management discipline is a cornerstone to our strategy of achieving and maintaining an appropriate return through the cycle. We have been improving the diversification of our loan and lease mix while reducing the overall risk profile.
1,"Turning to slide 8. A year ago, we outlined a strategic vision for Endo and laid out our key strategic priorities, setting out to focus on those things that we can control. We articulated a clear vision, in which we aspire to be a highly focused generic and specialty branded company, delivering quality medicines to patients in need through excellence in development, manufacturing, and commercialization."
1,"Turning to slide 8. Through the addition of Varta and Rayovac, this acquisition truly enhances our multi-brand strategy to appeal to more consumers in all segments on a global scale. Through the combination of our brands, Energizer and Eveready, and Spectrum's Varta and Rayovac brands, we will be able to offer our customers a best-in-class portfolio of portable power and lighting solutions for a wide range of applications and price points."
1,"Two segments in our Pharmaceutical business, one is Generics, other is Specialty Pharmaceuticals-Injectable business. So, the margin increase, there is no sales increase in our Specialty Pharmaceutical business, and in Generic business as compared to Generic business and our strategy has been also to grow our Specialty Pharmaceutical business. So that is differentiated as compared to maybe other competitors in the Generic business."
1,"Two, to advance our R&D whole-product solutions pipeline by securing a regulatory clearances for at least four new products in fiscal 2018 and file for the first in-human use of either our below-the-knee or AV fistula access drug-coated balloon programs. And three, finalize and further delineate our commercialization strategy with potential distribution partners for proprietary products. Starting with TRANSCEND, we have started our pivotal trial comparing our SurVeil drug-coated balloon to the U."
1,"Two-thirds of advisors departing over the last 12 months had annual productivity of less than $75,000. As we previously discussed, we have forecasted a decrease in lower-performing advisors and a corresponding increase in average advisor productivity as the broker-dealer continues to evolve respective to our strategy. A key strategic goal set forth by Phil and the executive team is to transform the broker-dealer into a profitable and self-sustaining entity."
1,"Ultimately, our long-term objective is to drive solid and sustainable growth in both comparable store and online sales to increase customer visits and higher conversion rates in order to drive higher total sales, expand margins and grow earnings. Being mindful of the fact that these long-term goals will only be achieved if we increase investment now and properly execute the strategic priorities Alex has laid out, we are maintaining our guidance for the coming year which we had disclosed on a preliminary basis, excluding the potential impact of recent U. S."
1,"Understanding that, yes, in the SI business or System Integration business, there's lumpiness, right, because of the long tail and also the long kind of relatively longer gestation period. But it is actually the way we actually do our Hubbing strategy by combining the different services together so that we can actually provide a more recurrence in continuing services. So that's the strategy to aim to actually maintain the quarter-on-quarter growth."
1,"Value-based healthcare continues to gain momentum globally with the World Economic Forum and leaders of pharma, healthcare providers, regulators, and clinicians working together to understand how health outcome measurements can be used to better assess those drugs and devices which are delivering value in healthcare. As a sole CRO partner to ICHOM, ICON continues to support the scale-up initiative globally and we believe this complements our overall real-world evidence strategy and focus on patient-reported outcomes and mobile health technologies. ICON's ability to apply agile resourcing models, not only in full service but also FSP and hybrid outsourcing models, has led to further opportunities for our functional services business during 2017."
1,"Various other items also contributed to the increase in SG&A expenses, including some additional costs associated with our new building in San Diego and the unfavorable impacts from foreign currency exchange rates from period to period. While our objective is to have our cost of doing business closer to our target of 30% of net sales, we plan to continue to make investments in support of the fifth strategic initiative, operational excellence. And this will include investments in quality assurance, regulatory compliance and intellectual property protection in order to safeguard the blue and yellow can with a little red top."
1,"Vehicle positioning was one of the areas that we wanted to enhance our skills at. We're going to continue to look at wireless communication, signal data management, data prioritization, anything in those areas that will allow us to enhance our connected car strategy as it relates to V2X autonomy. Any of those areas are technologies that we're actively pursuing right now in the market and looking at."
1,"Very different sales models. One is C-level engagement around strategic priorities, and the other being the best solution for the departmental solution in its own right. In terms of the competition, again, I'm not going to comment on specific competitors other than to say that the landscape review we've done at the competitive landscape highlights to us that there is no vendor with this true front to back integrated, modern, scalable, upgradeable open architecture platform that we have in place today."
1,"Volume obviously helps in that from   it comes from the economy. There are more start-ups that give all of us a better opportunity to get some volume growth, but our core price strategy isn't going to change for our core collection customers. We're still   the marketplace allows it, we go get that core price increase and we will in 2018."
1,"Walmart remains a world-class retailer and traffic aggregator, and they continue to draw customers to their brick-and-mortar stores, but attractive locations are not exclusive to collocating with the Walmart, and there are fewer good locations left. Thus we have retooled our real estate strategy to put the right assets in the right locations to generate the right returns and better compete for customer visits while staying within our capability set. The fourth and final takeaway is we are well-positioned as we enter 2018, with a strong balance sheet and free cash flow profile to continue the execution of our capital allocation strategy."
1,"We achieved a record 67. 4% operating ratio, which was 150 basis point improvement over 2016, demonstrating our focus on productivity, cost control, and growth as we move forward onto our strategic plan. Each of these achievements is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employees whose determination has powered our successes of the past several years and who, I'm confident, will make Norfolk Southern even stronger in 2018."
1,"We acquired a global leader in offshore MMO market, funded by successful AUD 322 million capital rise. The integration of the business is exceeding expectations, and our strategic plan is gaining traction. Our markets are at the bottom of the cycle and improving."
1,"We already have many steps that we're working on. Again, we mentioned some of those in the fourth quarter, the restructuring of our strategy in Europe and the severances associated with that. The restructuring of our strategy in the concrete space, focusing on really six market areas, and certainly, the severances associated with that model."
1,"We also   if I may comment on the kind of rationale for the disposals, to what Vesa was saying, I mean we have a very clear mindset in mind in terms of what our strategy is. So, it's essentially kind of global cloud growth."
1,"We also achieved our 2017 Beacon-related savings targets and now expect to realize the full program benefits 18 months ahead of schedule. As we look forward to this year, we are well positioned to achieve our 2018 financial objectives and key strategic priorities including advancing our digital leadership, while controlling expenses and delivering on behalf of clients. And with that, let me turn it back over to Jay."
1,We also announced that we'll be opening new flagship stores in Times Square and on Madero Street in Mexico City this year. Our company-operated retail stores are an important part of our marketplace strategy to elevate the consumer experience by giving them personalization and customization that they can't get anywhere else. The investments we've made in the online shopping experience are also paying off with 20% growth this year.
1,"We also believe that we are well positioned to create shareholder value over the long term. We are a leader in a growing global category, we have advantaged scale and capabilities, we are focused on executing on a clear set of strategic priorities and we take a balanced returns-based approach to capital allocation. Now, let me turn the call over to Rob to provide the details on our second quarter results and our updated outlook for the year."
1,"We also capitalized on continuing strength from our Other Thermal segment which achieve excellent margins and contributed significantly to our results due in part to the highly positive market fundamentals in the international thermal markets. In addition to those accomplishments, we also made positive strides on ongoing strategic initiatives, taking steps to reward our shareholders, bolster our financial foundation and streamline our operating portfolio. In particular, we're proud of the great progress we've made on our capital return program."
1,"We also continue to finalize partnerships to develop the other assets received in connection with the bankruptcy settlement with the City of Detroit. I would now like to update you on the progress we are making on some of our other strategic initiatives. In addition to those positive agreements reached in the last few months, we continue to progress the sale of our American Roads asset."
1,"We also ensure that the stores which are providing exceptional customer service are accurately reflecting that in customer reviews online. From a timing standpoint, we expect to complete the work to our marketing strategy by the middle of fiscal 2019. We've got a lot of ground to cover, but we're off to a great start."
1,"We also enter FY 2019 having made two very strategic acquisitions, Voxter Communications, which positions us to serve larger-sized businesses with a full-featured UCaaS solution using unique strategic approach; and Butterfleye, which gives us a leading solution in the cloud security camera space. Before expanding on our strategic priorities though, I'd first like to recap our Q4 progress. Once again, in Q4, I believe Ooma outperformed our industry by growing our business subscription services revenues approximately 55% year-over-year and by growing our residential subscription services revenues by approximately 13% year-over-year."
1,"We also have a pristine balance sheet, which has been used in the past and we will continue to use in the future as we evolve the capital allocation policy. Our governance now is stable and with that, we now look at our strategic priorities that we lay out at the April Investor Day. That's what I wanted to share with you from our call today."
1,"We also have additional plans to explore JCAR017 in CLL. JCAR017 represents an anchor molecule within our multi-modality approach to the treatment of lymphoma, including protein homeostasis and epigenetics, and it also accelerates our strategy to build global leadership in this important therapeutic area. JCAR017 represents a near-term U."
1,"We also have Lance Tucker, who's going to be joining the company as our new CFO . As all of you know, Jerry Rebel announced that he'd retire last year and we do expect in the coming months as Jerry leaves and Lance transitions in, he will have a sense of urgency around some of the things that we need to do to update our long-term plan, restructure, and also bring down our G&A. And so, within the long-term plan, some of the initial things that he'll be working on that we'll expect to speak a little bit about during our May call will be what the leverage targets will be and how we will get to those new targets over time."
1,"We also invested in structural productivity, as evidenced by our strategic actions at our Leverkusen, Germany facility. Our strong 2017 results continue to validate our strategic plan and reflect two consecutive years of significant year-over-year segment EBITDA gains and margin improvements. Turning to slide 5, we'll review our fourth quarter 2017 financial results."
1,"We also plan to continue the practice of evaluating capital levels at year end to determine if the special dividend is appropriate. In addition, we plan to evaluate a number of strategic initiatives for business reinvestment. For the fourth quarter of 2017, without the onetime tax expense, earnings for the quarter were $35 million, an increase of $4 million or 13% over the fourth quarter a year ago."
1,"We also posted two tables with information that we'll refer to on the call. Today, Chris and Bill will discuss elements of our financial and business performance, trends in our served markets, our strategy, our Complexity Reduction Initiative and our guidance. David will discuss highlights within our Plasma business."
1,"We also remain focused on acquiring premium timberland assets and continuing to meet our enduring goal of aggregating the highest quality timberland portfolio in the industry. Taken together, all of our activities and strategic initiatives positions CatchMark to generate the cash flow and growth to cover and increase our dividend over time, enhancing shareholder value. All of us at CatchMark look forward to delivering a highly productive and strong 2018 result, building on the gains to-date."
1,"We announced a definitive agreement on January 16 to sell our Global Batteries and Lighting business to Energizer Holdings for $2 billion in cash in a transaction expected to close before the end of calendar 2018. This was a significant step in our announced strategy to reshape Spectrum Brands into a faster-growing, higher-margin, and more focused consumer brands company. We are in the early stages of marketing our Personal Care and Small Appliance business as the other key component of our intention to divest our Global Batteries & Appliances segment in 2018 and we are in active discussions with interested parties."
1,We anticipate capital spending of $3. 5 billion for 2018 as we seek continued opportunities to invest in our markets and in support of key strategic initiatives. We estimate depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.
1,"We anticipate that our go-forward tax rate will decrease to approximately 25%. Excluding this expense and other strategic initiatives, our net income and earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 would have been $10. 1 million or $0."
1,"We anticipate that tax reform will have a positive impact on an already strong economy and on our target market of small-to-medium size businesses whether through wage inflation, employment growth, additional growth in the economy or by enabling companies to offer new or enhanced benefit packages. 2018 won't be without its challenges, but we are excited about the prospects a new year brings and remain confident in our ability to execute on our strategy to continue to deliver above-market growth. This concludes our prepared remarks."
1,"We anticipate total CapEx spend in fiscal 2018 to be between CAD 60 million and CAD 65 million. Overall, we continue to make strong progress on our strategic initiatives and we remain on track to meet or exceed our stated 2021 performance targets. With that overview of our third quarter, I will now turn it back to our Founder, CEO and Chairman before we welcome questions."
1,"We apologize for the line going dead for a few minutes, but we rectified that. I would say that, our business has performed exceptionally well for the first nine months of fiscal 2018, and we are very confident that we'll continue to sustain our profitable growth by executing on our TBA premiumization strategy. And just as a reminder, during our next quarterly call, we will be providing guidance for the upcoming fiscal year."
1,"We are actively looking and we   as we said, we've had a strategic planning process that really helps us kind of hone in on the growth opportunities across our businesses. We are looking and I think one the things that has kept us successful historically is that we are very strategic about the acquisitions and we don't do acquisitions just for growth."
1,"We are aligned on our goal to build a best-in-class operating platform with flexible low-cost assets, an increasingly optimized supply chain, an enhanced sales and marketing platform and a focus on developing the talented team we need to win in our markets. While there is more work to do ahead, we are successfully executing on our strategy to become a building solutions leader with a large and growing specialty products business. All of this is supported by a strong balance sheet that will provide us with the flexibility to deploy capital with the highest return opportunities."
1,"We are also further investing in training programs, ensuring that our people are well equipped with the tools and resources they need to best serve our customers. So, we expect 2018 to be a year in which OneMain drives our momentum and strategic priorities forward. We will stick to what we do best, providing our customers with the right products to improve their financial standing and flexibility."
1,"We are also having discussions about many additional use cases ranging from applications as diverse as infrastructure design, smart cities, airport management, urban planning and even the optimum placement of outdoor advertising. Our initial focus is on large enterprise customers and as we learn more, we will release our 3D product and pricing strategy laid out in the second half. I'll now hand back to Andy to provide more detail on first half results."
1,"We are also pleased to have contributed over AED 65 million to charities and social causes during the year. In 2018, we aligned our CSR activities and strategy, the Year of Zayed initiative to honor the legacy of our nation's founding father. Outside of the UAE, we continue to expand our international presence and opened our first branch in India in August."
1,"We are confident that it will expand our ability to compete in the marketplace and help us achieve our ultimate goal of double-digit revenue growth. As it relates to the third element of our strategic plan, tenaciously pursuing cost savings, this is clearly evident when you look at our margin increase in the current six-month period as compared to the prior-year six-month period. The margin improvement of 240 basis points experienced through the first half of our fiscal year adds momentum to the margin improvement we saw in our most recent fiscal year end results."
1,"We are confident that our investment in infrastructure will continue to pay off, allowing us to capture additional opportunities. Also, our strong balance sheet will allow us to execute on our strategy of facilitating engagement and delivering major projects through multiple top tier operators. Now, moving onto the results of the fourth quarter."
1,"We are confident that the development path we are on will lead to new opportunities within automotive and further down the road, sectors beyond automotive. I firmly believe that as we continue to execute our strategic plan over the next few years, it will provide sustainable and possible growth opportunities for the company and its stakeholders. Michelle, now to you."
1,"We are confident we are addressing these issues in 2018 and see a path for gross margin expansion in 2019 and beyond. Overall strategic planning cycle, we expect adjusted gross margin to increase. We have a strong productivity culture and track record."
1,"We are doing the same thing with our recently acquired Summit ESP business. Overall, our effective, clear and sustainable strategy combined with market momentum and our dedicated employees give me confidence that Halliburton is best positioned for the year ahead. We are the execution company."
1,"We are especially satisfied that this growth especially took place in two markets, North and South America and Asia because it's our clear company strategy to over-proportion or grow our business in these two markets. Therefore, this outperformance of more than 20% in NSA as well as more than 11% in Asia and Rest of the World, of course, especially in China I think is a good sign that our globalization strategy pays off and delivers the expected results. With regard to Europe, we develop more or less, on market level, minus 0."
1,"We are excited about bringing this business into the UniFirst family and the additional opportunities that it will provide us in that part of the country. Business acquisitions have historically been an integral part of our growth strategy, and we'll continue to seek out opportunities that make sense for us and support our long-term business objectives. I'd now like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our outlook for fiscal 2018."
1,"We are executing on a number of growth and productivity initiatives at both of these businesses which, we expect, will further enhance our competitive position and drive long-term profitability. Our growing cash flows and strong cash position provide significant flexibility to execute on our strategic plan and return capital to shareholders in the year ahead. I will now turn the call over to Tex."
1,"We are extremely proud of these accomplishments. Four years ago, we identified sustainable and profitable growth as a cornerstone of our business strategy. We have executed on this vision by providing customers with innovative technology solutions, continuing to streamline all aspects of our operations, improving our financial performance and investing in high growth solutions and markets."
1,We are focused on building the pillars of long-term sales growth by investing now and expanding our future sales capabilities. It is the strategic initiative or imperative to have a strong R&D program and we will continue to reinvest over 9% of sales back into our research and development activities. And this has been the key for the past two years to executing our new product drumbeat and driving our financial gains in 2017.
1,We are focused on moving our programs forward and hitting our timelines. We also announced our plans to merge with Idera which will accelerate the strategic initiatives of both organizations and will immediately form a substantial and differentiated biotech company; one that is serving patients in the rare disease community and is well-positioned to generate enhanced value for shareholders. APeX-1 data represented a significant milestone for BioCryst and since then we continue to move full steam ahead on BCX7353.
1,"We are in a very good, healthy financial position. We're obviously not commenting on any M&A opportunities, but what you should read out of the announcement this morning is we clearly have the intention to re-invest in the business according to our strategic priorities, strengthen our core capabilities with the cash balance we have on our balance sheet today. And that could be organic, it could be inorganic."
1,"We are in parallel doing many activities and new initiatives to further develop both what we offer our customers and the meeting with the customer, and this is impacting us both in the short term, but also an important platform to build forward on in the long term. And then thirdly in parallel, we are developing the long-term plan for growth that will be presented on May 3. So that concludes the presentation part."
1,"We are investing to capture these opportunities, and expect to maintain the 2017 momentum in 2018. We plan to deliver another strong year of sales and earnings growth and stay on track to fully achieving our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework goals. Now let me turn the call over to Jeff for a review of our results, details on our outlook and additional updates on our Framework."
1,"We are leveraging Nucor's five drivers to profitable growth, and they are, strengthen our position as a low-cost producer; achieve market leadership positions in every product line in our portfolio; move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher quality, higher margin products; expand and leverage our downstream channels to market to increase our steel mills' base load volume for sustained results; and achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength. I will now update you on highlights of our team's most recent work, executing our strategy for profitable growth. Nucor's Sheet Mill Group is implementing three major growth initiatives."
1,"We are looking forward to further growing this business both in terms of sales as well as margins. Another important component of our Lead Gas strategic initiative was our acquisition of the German company, Motortech, early in 2017. We believe the significant technical and market knowledge around gaseous-engine controls possessed by this company will play an important role in our future success with gas power-generation."
1,"We are making progress in these areas, and believe that these actions will contribute to year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA in 2018. Improved adjusted EBITDA, combined with debt repayment, and in the absence of any major acquisitions or strategic initiatives requiring capital, is expected to improve our net interest bearing debt to rolling 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio to 4. 5 times by the end of 2018."
1,"We are moving forward. I mean, our objectives are the same, increasing our private collection, as I call it, our collection of private assets, gradually lowering our exposure to   publicly to the mature publicly traded companies and lowering our leverage, I think these are the three pillars of our strategy. And further cultivating, what we call, our mid-stage companies, our European entities that still need work and help from us."
1,"We are not providing specific guidance for cash flows, but we expect free cash flows to be up year-over-year both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue. To conclude, our strategy remains unchanged. We are building our go-to-market engine for long-term sustainable and profitable growth."
1,"We are optimistic about 2018 and have momentum in every business line. Slide 8 illustrates our long-term financial goals which were approved by the board in the fall of 2014 as part of our strategic planning process. These goals were originally set with a five-year time horizon in mind, yet we achieved these long-term financial goals on a quarterly basis in the fourth quarter of 2017, in part due to the realization of the economic benefits of the FirstMerit acquisition."
1,"We are optimistic that more opportunities and sales will occur for our Epicentral SE. This again shows investors our strategy of providing more technology-driven solutions in our markets. Looking briefly at the balance of our business, the lottery business remains healthy and spare parts sales, obviously, benefited our results tremendously in 2017."
1,"We are pleased by the progression of our business over the course of 2017. The operating disciplines implemented by our leadership team are improving the predictability and performance of our business as we execute our strategic plan to grow our software and services revenue, while sustaining our profitable hardware business. During 2017, we continue to win large software and hardware deals; and our pipeline for 2018 gives us confidence in our outlook."
1,"We are pleased this initiative has progressed as planned, and is substantially complete, with final steps expected to be finished during the first half of 2018. Another major strategic initiative is the construction of our new lease production facility in Miami. We expect to begin production in this new 330,000 square foot facility by the end of the first quarter of 2018, and are excited about the additional production space and flexibility this facility provides us."
1,"We are pleased to have built two well-established businesses, each of which are clear leaders in their respective industries. Both will benefit from greater focus and dedicated leadership, enabling them to further pursue distinct strategic plans that will drive targeted investments and attractive growth. This spin transaction will also allow shareholders to independently value and invest in two different and compelling investment opportunities based on each company's market, competitive, operational and financial characteristics."
1,"We are pleased to report strong third quarter results and a continuation of year-over-year revenue and earnings growth. Our financial performance over the last several quarters is a result of executing on various strategic initiatives that we have pursued over the last few years combined with favorable market conditions. We reported $259 million in revenues this quarter, up 5% from last year, and the highest quarterly level in the firm's history."
1,"We are starting robotics implementation in our stores here in Canada and in are piloting in Canada the automation of store processes to help us absorb these increases. This is coupled with other strategic initiatives that will help us remain competitive in this market and we are also working on multiple level across the company to use our scale to decrease the cost base always leveraging our size with our business partners. So, we feel that we can keep these cost increase under control."
1,"We are still expecting to see upper single-digit growth for the full year of 2018. As we look into this year and our continued ability to grow the loan portfolio will be a key focus of our strategic plan. We are very satisfied to see an increase in loans across our footprint, even in the face of strong competitive market pressures, particularly in pricing as our institutions are more aggressively seeking increased loan volume."
1,"We are still very much on track for our submission later this year and our first indication. As we get closer to that submission date, we will give the market more clarity as to our go-to-market strategy for that first indication. Also pleased to report that the second indication, which we have identified and gone public on, infantile spasms, that study is currently operational and beginning to enroll."
1,"We are strengthening our enterprise business with our HyperScale solutions and partnerships with Microsoft, and Cisco, and new key partners like HPE and INFINIDAT. In summary, the strategic initiatives that we launched in FY 2018 are designed to improve financial performance by strengthening our competitive position, open up new market opportunities, and significantly improve field productivity through distribution leverage. Our objective now is to achieve our Q4 objectives and solidify the foundation for FY 2019."
1,"We are the fastest-growing digital, outdoor, and sports media business in Australia and New Zealand. We are committed to the delivery of strategic priorities of multi-platform engagement, content creation applications, and data technology and analytics. These pillars will continue to be the core of our success and we remain committed to building our capabilities in these areas, as evidenced by the progression of our strategic agenda in the first half."
1,We are trying to enter there. So our strategy is get into that market and increase our share of business. So that's what we are doing currently and that is what our strategy going forward.
1,"We are very positive that during 2018, the activity increased, and we shall be able to monetize some of our already transformed farms. We are well aware that we need to remain focused to succeed in our strategy to maintain low cost of production of each of the commodities that we produce and generate value for our shareholders throughout the commodity cycle. Now, I will let Charlie walk you through the numbers of the quarter."
1,"We believe all of our reporting groups have the opportunity to be up on sales and net income for the year. Acquisitions remain a key piece of our growth strategy along with organic growth. To that end, we continue to work on potential additions to the Astec family of companies."

Number two, increasing user acquisition and retention through collaboration with the Alipay Digital Wallet."
1,We believe in the power of our brick-and-mortar stores in that future world. Our standard to small strategy has improved inventory productivity as these 300 stores have produced comp sales consistent with the company's sales results on inventory levels well below the average full-sized store. This has led to merchandise margin improvement well above the average store.
1,"We believe it's going to work because we have an inventory that supports it, and we're going to go execute on this plan. Going to slide 9, this is the way to think about it from a longer-term perspective as to how the long-term plan affects our financial metrics, and you can see that they improve significantly. If you look at the top left graph, for instance, you see that the cash flow modeling   this again is based on $55 and $3   is a consistent CAGR of over 20%, which actually yields in the full plan period an increase to over $11 billion of cash flow, again based on $55 and $3, so substantial cash flow growth."

But at any rate, since everything has been reassessed, well, of course in the strategic plan, we'll continue to reassess the synergies of this business with the rest of infrastructure business. Our clear and the good results due to the   despite the volatility of the business are obvious, the company has always had positive and favorable results even at difficult times for international markets such as last year."
1,We believe Tech Data has these critical components in place and it has us positioned to be able to move forward in the market very efficiently. Our strategy really is built on four pillars. The first is to continue to invest in these next-generation technologies that continue to evolve and create new market opportunity.

To accomplish our objectives, we intend to run independent registrational trials in both newly diagnosed patients, first-line or incident patients and in prevalent patients who are already receiving therapy, for example, an ERA and/or PDE-5. Our registrational study covering first-line treatment of newly diagnosed patients will utilize ralinepag compared to placebo in combination with both a PDE-5 and an ERA, which represents upfront triple combination therapy."

Coming back now from this specific win to the broader cloud picture, this design win as well as many of our other recent wins reflects the fruits of our successful cloud and cloud-related strategy, which leverages the ongoing industry transition towards cloud technologies at both the data center and the edge. While we have had significant success, I know that our cloud journey is still in its early stages, and as each quarter passes, we become even more optimistic with regard to its power to drive our business to a whole new level."
1,"We believe that, in addition to the trends and styles customers want, today's stores have the right mix of products and price points to continue inspiring shoppers in fiscal 2019. Next step, new store expansion continues to be one of our most important strategic priorities. We believe that the mark of a great retailer is the ability to drive growth from both new and existing stores simultaneously."
1,"We believe the market is still undersupplied and hungry for additional top-performing people and equipment. This demand, coupled with the long-term plans of our customers, gives us clear visibility to continue to confidently invest capital into our business. In addition, we expect pricing for our services to remain solid while we continue our methodical and tactical approach to increasing profitability by partnering and collaborating with our customers."
1,"We believe the tax bill will be an overall net positive for AIG over the long term and look forward to the benefits of additional economic growth. Last quarter, I spoke to the urgency this management team has to execute on our strategic priorities. I'm confident in the changes that are taking place at AIG."
1,"We believe these actions will ensure that our teammates are well-trained to assist, educate and address our customers' needs, providing an in-store experience that is worthy of our customers' trust and long-term patronage. To ensure we reach our objectives we are increasing transparency and accountability throughout the organization by providing the right tools to our field managers, so they can enact real change at the store level. To do this effectively, we are investing in and leveraging technology."
1,"We believe these changes will enhance RESG's future production, efficiency, and customer service, all allowing for continued growth from this important division. Collectively, these strategic initiatives should position us well for 2018. Now, let me turn the call back to Tim."
1,"We believe these efforts will lead to continued improvements in our credit ratings. Overall, we made significant progress on our strategic priorities that we laid out for the year, and we look forward to building on the strong foundation in 2018. With that, I'll turn the call back to Jay for his closing remarks."
1,We believe we are well-positioned in a dynamic industry to capture the growth opportunities laid out today. All of the hard work our team did in 2017 laid the foundation and set us up well to hit the ground running and execute on our strategic priorities. We'll continue to position the company for further growth and profitability as we deliver on our commitments to all our stakeholders.
1,"We believe we can grow sales to both of these consumer groups simultaneously. Our three-pronged e-commerce strategy addresses both a younger market by providing a wealth of information, access and buying opportunities for the La-Z-Boy brand to all consumers. Our first objective is to increase online sales of La-Z-Boy furniture through la-z-boy."
1,"We believe we're well positioned for a promising 2018. During the year, we implemented strategic priorities to increase our focus on the consumer and remove complexity and cost from our business. We generated strong cash flow to reduce debt and support dividend growth."
1,"We bring some   still getting it in from the Ukraine, a little bit in from the Ukraine. But clearly, our overall long-term strategy is to focus on DRI and to use prime scrap from the domestic market. So, DRI has always been part of the plan and will continue to be part of the plan."
1,"We build Alliance by focusing on a goal of creating sustainable long-term growth in cash flows to support increased distributions to unitholders.

I am confident more than ever that we have the strategy, the market and the team to build a $1 billion business."
1,"We closed the Carton Craft, Norgraft, and Seydaco acquisitions. The acquisitions we closed in 2017 met key strategic priorities we look for in potential opportunities, specifically an enhanced product, customer, and geographic profile and further run rate to reduce our costs. The integration of these acquisitions is on plan."
1,"We completed our â‚¬100 million fixed cost savings program which has enabled us then to, for example, start investing in new things, some of which I mentioned. This has been a very important strategic initiative also. We are taking out cost from, in a way, the existing operations and older things in order to be able to then invest into our future."
1,"We continue to be very excited about the potential of our opportunities in our new UK and Continental Europe operations, because it creates a stronger, more diverse and much more stable global chicken and chicken-based prepared foods leader in Pilgrim's. The acquisition aligns well with our strategic priorities, as we continue expanding our geographical and brand footprint and extending our global poultry leadership position in attracted new markets while providing us a solid platform in the region for future growth. We're already seeing some of the results of sharing knowledge due to the acquisition."
1,"We continue to be very positive regarding the benefits to our customer community and all of our stakeholders by bringing our two companies together. As our fourth quarter and full-year financial results demonstrate, our strategy for long-term profitable growth is gaining momentum and generating results. I'm very pleased that our team remains focused on sustaining top performance."
1,"We continue to expect breakeven cash flow for the full-year 2018 and we are very comfortable for where the Q1 and the full year consensus EBITDA estimates have landed. Looking ahead to 2019, our objectives are to cut our debt-to-EBITDA ratio in half and to exit the year with $1 billion run rate and improved earnings. The debt-to-EBITDA goal will be achieved through a combination of factors including the planned divestitures, and the successful execution of our $1 billion in profit improvements, which will bring in cash and enable us to pay down debt."
1,"We continue to focus on diversifying our core and on lighter-weight categories, accessories, knitwear are all things that are important to us. These are strategic   I think it's important to continue to hammer home our strategy, which is not to   we're not looking at these categories, especially new categories like knitwear, as categories that we're going to try drive material growth. We're not relying on them for the growth of this business."
1,"We continue to gain market share with traditional and e-commerce retail customers and are expecting that our recently introduced new Octane branded products will help drive growth in our commercial and specialty Retail channels of distribution as well. With 2017 financial performance coming in well below our expectations, we recognized that we needed to increase our focus and provide added investments in key strategic initiatives in order to drive the desired higher levels of revenue and operating growth. As mentioned, our 2018 plan is multifaceted and will involve approximately $3 million to $4 million in incremental expenses and $5 million to $6 million in additional capital expenditures."
1,"We continue to invest our available capital to maximize shareholder value. We remain focused on our M&A pipeline and executing our strategy of bolt-on string-of-pearls acquisition targets to enhance and broaden our service offerings and grow our company. In conjunction with this, we are continuing to repurchase shares under the previously announced $400 million share repurchase program."

We closed the transformative combination with International Paper's North America Consumer Packaging business on January 1."
1,"We continue to meet the demands of our customer for higher broadband speeds and IPTV services, by leveraging the fiber deployments we've made in our most competitive market, our ILEC markets specifically. In total, about 20% of our network route miles are fiber-built as a direct result of our fiber deployment strategy over the last several years. Our network investments are driving positive results as shown in the metrics on the bottom of the slide."
1,"We continue to operate our facilities as carrier, cloud and managed services neutral facilities, which attracts valuable deployments which drive commerce and interconnections among our customers. We executed well on our strategic priorities in 2017 with full-year organic revenue growth of 20% and FFO growth of 22%. We took important steps to grow our differentiated scalable and flexible multi-tenant campuses in key markets including Santa Clara, Northern Virginia, Los Angeles and most recently Chicago."
1,"We continue to see additional upside potential with key catalysts such as the metastatic breast cancer launch of BRAC CDx. Perhaps more importantly, we remain well-positioned to deliver on our long-term financial goals given the significant progress we have made on our strategic initiatives. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mark."
1,We continue to see great liquidity at strong evaluations for assets that we do not want to hold. And I really want to make that point very clearly that we're achieving these cap rates on assets that are in markets that are secondary in many cases tertiary that aren't consistent with our long-term plan. And I think our execution both what we did in the quarter and what we've done year to date really underscores that.
1,We continue to see strong demand for our value-added product mix in OSB; the FlameBlock and Legacy flooring growth exceeding our expectations. We are pleased that our OSB strategy of focusing on value-add and specialty products is reflected in the decline of commodity volume and the increase in value-add specialty volume. Pricing remain robust and we continued to make progress on productivity and our cost improvement initiatives.
1,"We continued to invest behind delivering a superior customer experience, with the majority of spend on store's IT and supply chain. Subsequent to year-end, on March 3, as part of our strategy to focus on our core business and unlock cash flow, we sold our MW Cleaners business for $18 million. With respect to real estate, during the fourth quarter, we closed two Joseph A."
1,"We could also have added CKD, kidney disease, because we also have a problem in kidney disease. And that's really where actually our strategy takes its full potential because we're going to be in kidney disease, we're going to be in heart failure with a variety of products, Farxiga of course. roxadustat in kidney disease, Lokelma in cardiology, we have Brilinta."
1,"We could have had zero cooperative shares that wouldn't have been a problem as far as I'm concerned. In the strategic plan for TEC 2020, we included a hypothesis of increasing by 50 basis points the cooperative shares from 2018 to 2020, but this is a hypothesis, this is not actual target that we are trying to follow."
1,"We could point to numerous other ongoing investments in various stages of development. More recently, one of our more significant investments in our multi-year strategic initiative called the Universal Digital Bank. Our goal of this initiative is to develop a state-of-the-art open architecture banking platform that is highly personalized for each individual user."
1,"We couldn't be more excited to have you and the MuleSoft team join Salesforce.

Behind every device, every app, every event, everything, there's a customer who expects a new level of engagement."
1,"We currently expect that Ambrell's 2018 net revenues will grow at an annual rate of between 9% and 13%. On the expense side, we expect to see an increase in our operating expenses related to some investments we're making in connection with the implementation of our strategic initiatives, primarily related to our acquisition strategy which will add approximately $800,000 to our operating expenses during 2018. In summary, we see another strong year for inTEST and expect that our revenues for 2018 will be in the low- to mid-$70 million range prior to the impact of any future acquisitions."
1,"We currently had a fraction of our customers using RD sensors leaving good potential ahead for further adoption and associated margin improvement. We're starting 2018 with a new long-term plan that includes action to propel our global growth, and an ever expanding product portfolio that includes more breakthrough medical products, some of which will be announced later this year. We anticipate a steady flow of clinical data from luminary clinical investigators that demonstrate the clinical benefits from the use of our technologies."
1,"We delivered strong results in 2017 that made significant progress that positions the company for growth and strong financial results in 2018 and beyond. Our performance reflected the successful execution of our strategic priorities to grow the business organically through strategic investments and through dropdowns. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter net earnings of $59 million and EBITDA of $277 million."
1,We delivered to our financial goals and remain committed to further progress in 2018. I want to thank our employees for executing on our key business strategy. This focus has delivered significant benefit to our financial results.
1,"We did particularly well over Black Friday and Christmas with some well-executed plans. Service-related sales continued to grow at a faster rate than total sales, and there was further progress in delivering our strategic initiatives as we continue to strengthen Halfords' credentials as a specialist service-led retailer. The results for our full year will be reported on the 22nd of May."
1,"We did this partially in-house and partially through acquisition of capabilities, and typically we buy a small company that has one or two applications, and then we take them to a different level by integrating them into the rest of the applications, number one; and number two, by allowing our sales force to take it to market, to clients who would not have otherwise considered buying from a small outfit. That has been our strategy. And early on post-merger, we identified a great opportunity on the clinical technology side."
1,We do expect that the retail deposit base will increase further with the conversion of many of our existing branches into full-fledged bank branches in the forthcoming quarters and extensive mobilization of deposits through existing customer base also apart from tapping the open market. Our branch conversion has also been successfully implemented as per our strategic plan. Our deposits covered 36% of advances in Q3 as against 22% in Q2.
1,"We do not intend to borrow further to support repurchases, but continue to believe that our shares are undervalued relative to our peers. As such, repurchases will continue to play a role in our capital deployment strategy. Finally, we maintained a strong balance sheet to preserve our capability to pursue any compelling and accretive inorganic growth opportunities that may arise at various points within business cycles."
1,"We do see a very positive development in other markets and industries and applications besides the dairy processing and beverage, as we also have seen in the year 2017 as you may remember from my previous slide, that growth in order intake besides dairy processing was about 5%, which is very good for GEA. We of course are working very hard on further improvement potential from strategic initiatives and that will help us. We will try in the supply management besides the normal day-to-day supply chain saving activities we are taking to now also source more in the weak currency regions to try to offset part of that exchange rate headwind and last but not least, but I think at the end of the day mid and long term, it's the most important issue, is we will further leverage on GEA innovation technologies, because that's at the end of the day our guarantee to survive mid and long term."
1,"We don't have to build all of that expertise internally. So, that is certainly an area where we have a long-term commitment and where the relationship with Allergan is exemplary of our business development strategy as well because it really helps us accelerate in an area and be expert in it faster than we would have if we had to build it all on our own. Clearly, second area where we have already commitment and will continue is the   within ex vivo, the relationship through Celgene with engineered T cells and in oncology in that area."
1,"We don't think we're missing investment opportunities at this point. The one area where we have   which we're finding right now is being able to fund in the Street, our capital strategy and M&A strategy, what that's going to look like. But I don't feel   Mike, you can   feel free to chime in."
1,"We ended 2017 with approximately $196 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. Denny's stock price outperformance since launching our brand revitalization strategy seven years ago reflects the success of these initiatives. During the timeframe, Denny's stock price increased by 270%, significantly outperforming both the S&P SmallCap 600 Index and the S&P SmallCap 600 Restaurants Index."
1,"We ended 2017 with solid Q4 financial results that came in at the high-end of our outlook.

1,"We estimate that the recently passed tax reform will result in an effective tax rate of approximately 25% during 2018 compared to our historical rate of 38% to 39%. Looking ahead, we plan to use some of this tax benefit to accelerate investments in our strategic initiatives, which will result in increased SG&A expenses throughout 2018. As always, I commend all our employees for their dedication to our company."
1,"We estimate that these onetime mechanical issues and related repairs will result in a production shortfall of 14,000 short ton in the first two months of the year. Looking briefly at our strategic initiative during the quarter, we announced the acquisition of four facilities and the purchase of 33% ownership position in Tencorr Holdings Corporation in Ontario on December 4 that will strengthen our position in Ontario containerboard packaging sector. I'm also pleased to note that we successfully increased our equity holdings of the Greenpac Mill from 62."
1,"We executed several deals to further tech and talent expansion. And in Q3, we optimized our strategy in India by taking an ownership interest in Flipkart in exchange for our eBay India business and a $500 million cash investment. Heading into 2018, we will stay consistent in our strategy, continuing to improve our user experiences while delivering profitable growth and strong capital return to our shareholders."
1,"We expect a moderate increase in the raw material prices throughout 2018. In this environment, based on the strong performance in 2017 and substantial progress made in implementation of the strategic priorities, we reconfirm our financial ambition for 2020. Organic sales growth of 2% to 4%, continued increase in adjusted EBIT margin, adjusted EPS growth of 7% to 9%."
1,"We expect continued strength in cash generation in the future. When combined with our strong balance sheet and credit profile, we expect it will support our strategic plans and priorities. With this in mind as I mentioned earlier, our approach to capital allocation remains consistent."
1,"We expect growth in all activities and we have already anticipated and charged â‚¬110 million of the restructuring costs to 2017. So, without a doubt, the new strategic plan we've been working on and with our new Chairman, will help to develop and take to prevalent to the markets will be the right thread of the immediate activities of the company. At any rate, the commitment of the company has been this year to adjust to the current plan and work for the future."

For example, we recently announced the formation of four classes of membership."

We expect that our remuneration and other costs will be higher as a result of the investments we are making and strategic initiatives, including the MTF at the U. S."
1,"We expect minimal domestic capacity growth in a range of 3% to 5%. Moreover, it is important to highlight that this growth results from our upgauging strategy as our number of shells in the fleet is expected to grow only by one shell, from 131 to 132 planes. I am delighted to announce that we will be launching our new branded fares across the next few weeks, offering our passengers a wider choice of products that are tailored to their needs."
1,"We expect NDS to be a net contributor to our revenue and profit growth in 2018. In wrapping up my section, we are very pleased with the organic revenue growth and profitability that we achieved in the fourth quarter as well as execution towards our strategic priorities for the full year. Novanta's leadership position across growing medical and industrial markets, combined with our disciplined approach to M&A, is providing a solid foundation for sustainable profitable growth."
1,We expect P3 Protect contracts to create a recurring revenue source for our parts business while allowing our customers to budget and have predictable replacement part in tube cost. Our strategy in healthcare has not changed. We will play a significant role in the development and sale of diagnostic imaging replacement parts around the world.
1,We expect that operating margins will be significantly better in the second half based on a higher revenue level and after addressing our cost structure. Our long-term strategy is unchanged. We continue to win business and diversify our markets with a focus on mission critical products and we provide more value to our customers.
1,"We expect that this, combined with our already strong balance sheet and enhanced cash flow generation capabilities due to the tax reform, will provide the company with significant liquidity in the near-term. We are currently reevaluating our capital allocation strategy and are looking at further opportunities in addition to our current share repurchase program to put this cash to use in a way that we are able to profitably grow the business and drive shareholder value. We plan on providing more color on our plans on the next earnings call, but currently our main focus is on the $400 million share repurchase program we announced last October."

Well, where there are, we will certainly take advantage of them to speed-up the reduction of the volume of this portfolio."
1,"We expect to begin using a site sometime in the second quarter. In summary, we continue to systematically implement our strategic plan. First, we said we would strengthen the foundation of our company by investing in our current manufacturing assets to improve competitiveness and upgrade our systems to support growth."

We look forward to leveraging our strong balance sheet to accelerate our growth."

Regarding small brands, as you're calling them, our group strategy is one that's very much based on a portfolio with differing levels of brand maturity. You see we're fortunate we've got Gucci, and then Saint Laurent, and Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, McQueen come in line."
1,We flag the five-year horizon for two reasons. One is that we look at the world in five-year chunks commensurate with our strategic plan. And we really do think we can double the size of the business.

Moving to some of our key productivity initiatives on slide 14, we are continuing to drive improvement in all areas."

Our strong balance sheet, higher earnings and positive free cash flow will continue to support our investments in growth opportunities and our long-term strategic initiatives.

And along those lines, we felt very good about the opportunity to increase our return on capital commitment."
1,"We had a lot of headwinds, though turning into tailwinds. We have a number of key strategic initiatives that I've described to you which will have a big impact during the year and years beyond. We have a greater focus on organic growth which is a big deal."
1,"We had some other small modifications around the edges, but those were the two that drive the most significant portion. But in general, our strategy is to drive revenue growth through unit growth as opposed to simply taking rate. That hasn't changed."
1,"We had some very good exploration results at Lantern late in 2017, and we are making good progress working on establishing a five year mine plan involving higher production levels and grades for Northern territory.

1,"We have a relatively small business today in China. That business doubled last year off a small base and we're really evaluating our strategic plan to really capitalize on this for the future. But, I would say, maybe the biggest news today for International and Church & Dwight is, we believe that we really have achieved critical mass."
1,"We have a robust outlook for 2018, reflecting continued successful execution against our 2020 strategic plan, and Stuart will have more details shortly. Slide 5 is a review of highlights related to our strategic plan. In developed markets, which include both our North American RIM and Western European segments, we achieved internal storage revenue growth of 3."
1,"We have a robust pipeline heading into 2018 and we are confident in our business model, and, more importantly, our strategy. I invite you to learn more about our strategy and outlook and to see real-life results of our innovation investments by joining our upcoming Investor and Analyst Day scheduled for May 8 at the St. Regis in New York City."
1,We have a strategic enterprise customer base that serves the mainstream enterprise market in North America and we have our small and medium-sized business segments that serve small and medium. So I think that's the first thing knowing that these customers are distinct in their own needs and capital and strategic priorities and each of those segments have their own priorities and focus. I think the other big thing is that the scale that we now have in the U.
1,"We have a target of 2 to 2. 5 times net debt leverage, as we believe that this provides the right balance between reaching the optimal capital structure and preserving financial flexibility as we move forward on strategic initiatives. We currently operate a 3."
1,"We have a whole set of objectives around machine learning, analytics and cloud. That's kind of our strategic initiative. The next phase we're preparing for is why are you doing all this machine learning and that's the intelligent application phase and we're doing the early development to operationalize more and more ML apps into traditional enterprise processes and so that you could expect coming a few years down the road."
1,"We have acquired an extensive portfolio of digital assets over the past several years including OPENLANE, Autoniq, DRIVIN, TradeRev, and STRATIM to name a few, and we're working with our customers to better understand the future and position our businesses for the changes that are inevitable. Today, I would like to focus on three of those strategic priorities. First, let me talk about data and analytics capabilities."
1,"We have already have our EPC project leadership teams in place and are actively engaged in bidding a number of opportunities in both the renewables and oil and gas segments. So in summary, conditions continue to be challenging in our traditional markets of newbuild jackup rigs, but we are encouraged by the increasing quality and quantum of our bid pipeline and progress we have made with respect to our strategic initiatives. However, new awards are heavily weighted towards the end of 2018 and early 2019, and we therefore expect full year revenues to be in the $225 million to $300 million range."
1,"We have also won some non-IT deals, which are digital led so analytics, campaign, data, IoT. So our growth strategy in that particular relationship is now a more balanced strategy rather than just being traditional IT application and IT support strategy. And we have seen some very good traction and we've got some pretty good wins, that's the reason why you are seeing traction coming in into the top 5, 10, and 20 accounts, which is a part of our pretty strong performance over the last couple of quarters."
1,"We have an analysis updated and look at that ownership change. We don't disclose what the amount is, but it is something that we monitor and particularly in light of the change in our strategy and the potential for shareholder ownership changes."
1,"We have an opportunity to grow EBITDA further as we continue to work with these advisors to fully leverage our advisory platforms, technology tools and other capabilities to help their practices grow and thrive. Now that we have reviewed our 2017 results, I'd like to discuss our strategic priorities for 2018. We remain focused on growing our core business, executing with excellence and exploring M&A opportunities if they arise."
1,"We have been saying and anticipating that the industry is going to grow at that high end of that 35% to 45% range for a while, and so it really is more of a longer term statement as opposed to something that has changed over the last three to six months because of macroeconomic environment or something like that. And so it takes a while to invest in these things, long-term plans, and so we've seen the investment levels be pretty consistent or the growth levels. The one thing that we have seen recently that is an interesting dynamic is some companies that, one, are in the DRAM market as well as the NAND market and then have the flexibility to convert 2D NAND to DRAM, they appear to be doing that more so."
1,"We have begun work to stabilize the project and have initiated discussions with several potential buyers and are working to sell the property as soon as possible and practical. Our long-term focus is on continued improvements in return on average assets and our strategic goals and related strategic initiatives are focused on achieving ROAA results in the upper quartile of our peer group. As we look forward to 2018, we will remain focused on our seven key initiatives, which we have highlighted in our filings."
1,"We have increased the dividend at a compounded annual growth rate of 24% over the last five years. Our consistent growth of free cash flow resulted in our dividend in 2017 consuming only 45% of free cash flow, supporting our objectives of sustainability and growth of dividends. Let me now wrap up my prepared remarks with a few summary comments."
1,"We have long-term plans. And quite frankly, when we looked out   if you take the fuel of this last year, the capacity and the economic environment, there were markets that we wanted to continue to invest in, really not new markets, but add to some of the core."
1,"We have many more plans in the works to present different program configurations, offer relevant cross-sells, and encourage longer length of stay via more program enhancements over 2018, but we are more than pleased with the steps taken thus far and the path we are on. Our multi-brand strategy is now operational, we are segmenting the market to reach new customers with our second brand. We believe that our addressable market includes not only those people who have used the meal delivery weight loss program in the past, but also extend to those people who have tried losing weight on their own or by some means that requires them to plan, make or buy their food meal by meal."
1,We have no M&A transactions to discuss today. Our pipeline of potential acquisitions is consistent with our strategic priorities and we will continue to be patient and disciplined as we review opportunities to deploy capital for strategic growth. We will also continue to use our capital to repurchase KAR stock.
1,"We have published that you really need to correct to normal the accumulation of the pathological species of GAGs, and it remains to be seen whether that can be achieved from the blood slide of the blood-brain barrier. Our strategy has been the disease is a central nervous system disease. We can make enough proteins to deliver it directly into the central nervous system right into the   where the action is in the brain."
1,"We have purposely built the platform to be extremely flexible with one convenient website and one password, so that additional services can be seamlessly added in the future to create even more customer value. It is also based on a simple monthly subscription, which is aligned with our strategy to build new recurring sticky revenue models. The feedback so far has been very positive, and customers are impressed on how many ways we can partner with them and offer a wide variety of services and solutions."
1,"We have put in place the financial structures to support growth, and at the same time, we have committed to delivering attractive returns to shareholders whilst exercising costs and cash management. Looking forward, through 2018, we will continue to progress our strategy and we will continue to implement opportunities identified to improve operations and profitability, reduce costs and CapEx and optimize the use of working capital. I have provided some further guidance in the appendix with regards to EBITDA, current market consensus and assuming good operational performance through the year that remains sensible for 2018."
1,"We have rebalanced organic sources of supply, sources and uses of cash. We have a clear set of strategic priorities that are shaping how we will continue to generate value in a rapidly changing world. In the Upstream, we are focused on growing oil and gas in a way that offers us advantages in terms of margin and value, which contributes to our ambition to advance the low carbon energy transition."
1,"We have rolled out products specialists across all FNB markets, and we'll look to these units to help us achieve our double-digit long-term growth objective for total non-interest income. These are just a few of the major initiatives we've laid out as part of our long-term strategic plan, designed to fully leverage what we've built at FNB to meet our growth objectives and maintain our risk profile. The revenue and expenses associated with our strategic objectives are either embedded in our historical performance or included in our 2018 guidance."
1,"We have said from the beginning that the strength of our company is in our infrastructure and our ability to leverage that platform to transform our company. I'm pleased with the progress we made in 2017 to further leverage our infrastructure and advance our diversification strategy. Throughout the year, we focused on opportunities that would extend our marketing capabilities and global reach, while addressing the rapidly evolving consumer demand for healthier products."
1,"We have some great momentum in our JDM business. We have some great momentum on our M&A strategy. And after some strong growth that we've seen in CCS, we are experiencing some headwinds, but we do have the right actions in place to improve our margins as our transformation progresses."
1,"We have strengthened the underlying business and the company is poised for profitable growth. During the fourth quarter, we were pleased to see continued progress against our four overarching strategic priorities, which are Specialty growth; expanded margins and increased cash generation in mature businesses; portfolio optimization to accelerate our specialization strategy, while also strengthening the portfolio; and finally, progress on our One OMNOVA initiatives designed to make OMNOVA a more agile, efficient and lower-cost organization. Let me go into detail on some key achievements with respect to these priorities."
1,"We have the right strategy and we are committed to making our model work harder. We are reorganizing the company to create efficiencies, which we will reinvest behind the new strategic initiatives we've announced today. We are confident that these will deliver industry-leading and highly-profitable net rooms growth over the medium-term."
1,"We have the right strategy, and we are committed to making our model work harder. We are reorganizing the company to create efficiencies, which we will reinvest behind the new strategic initiatives we've announced today. We are confident that these will deliver industry-leading and highly-profitable net rooms growth over the medium term."
1,"We have tremendous opportunities ahead and we are all invested in capturing these. In summary, we delivered a strong 2017 that reflects strong execution and the acceleration of our strategic priorities. Heading into 2018, we plan to maintain our operational and strategic momentum as we continue to leverage the benefits of our global end market diversification."
1,"We have yet to fully capitalize on the patented technology and development opportunities that exist within our Finjan Mobile business unit. We have also yet to divulge our long-term plans for Finjan Blue. Despite the latter and as I alluded to earlier, the industry's interest in the patents that came in to Finjan Blue as a result of their assignment by IBM have already led to revenues into that business unit to offset the investment."
1,"We have, as a matter of fact, extended it to over 200 strategic employees, whom we consider to be the key in achieving Deliver 2022 targets, in such a large organization as Poste Italiane. The performance period is aligned to the strategic plan, five years for the plan, and for the first 60 managers and three years for the rest of the team. Consistent with our strategy, the performance measures are based on both revenues and cost."
1,"We improved our inventory management to achieve more profitable sales with higher regular-price selling and lower inventories. We also launched a modernized advertising campaign to promote our brand strategy. As I reflect on all of the changes we've made, I realized just how challenging and complex our issues were and how far we've come in just one year."
1,"We increased $100 million   raised $100 million additionally to fund for last year, while adding also new LPs to the fund. This condition supports our objectives to build and diversify our funding base. As we deploy more capital and apply modest leverage, our business will allow us to generate significant increase in earnings cash flows and our dividend."
1,"We intend to deploy the capture, use and management of data to build a competitive advantage. We also made progress in each of our businesses' strategic initiatives in 2017. As we announced in March, we successfully formed the new Corporate & Investment Bank into an integrated organization dedicated to delivering better commercial banking and capital markets capabilities to our core clients."
1,"We introduced the Tiffany Metro watch collection and we launched our new signature fragrance with great success. But as Alessandro said earlier, one of our strategic priorities is to accelerate the rate of product introductions. As one example, we will soon launch a new jewelry collection focused in platinum and diamonds, our first in many years."
1,We issued the press release for a couple of things. We had alluded on our fourth quarter earnings call that we were working on some strategic initiatives. We weren't quite ready at that point to really begin to provide some of the details around it.
1,"We know that we can turn around this company and we are announcing the first concrete results of this turnaround plan implementation. We will keep, over the next three years, a very clear Push to Pass strategic plan implementation process. As you know well, we want to become a great carmaker, not the biggest, but certainly the most efficient, cutting-edge efficiency in a chaotic world for a very brutal automotive industry."
1,"We look forward to both organic and inorganic growth to achieve that target. In Perpetual Private, we will continue to prosecute our strategy of targeting professionals, medical specialists and high net worth individuals, as well as growing the Fordham business. Let's now move to Perpetual Corporate Trust."
1,"We look forward to launching these exciting products which will enhance our market leadership position in fiscal year 2018 and beyond. Taken together, and excluding the benefit from tax reform, we expect that fiscal year 2018 will be in line with our strategic plan of doubling sales and profits by fiscal year 2021, executed through new product development, market expansions, strategic acquisitions, supported by a continuing evolution of the Cantel operating model. With the benefit from tax legislation changes, we anticipate fiscal year 2018 non-GAAP EPS of $2."
1,"We made quite visible changes in some product categories, introducing new unique SKUs, replacing some assortment, and improving the ranges. As part of this, we are implementing a long-term plan to improve our private-label offering. The number of private-label SKUs has increased by almost 30% since we started this, primarily in the medium and premium part of the assortment."
1,"We measure ourselves against this operational excellence initiative by executing against our 55/30/25 business model and by making improvements to processes and systems that will safeguard the blue and yellow can with the little red top. To complete the update on our strategic initiatives, so let's move on to the details of our first quarter results starting with sales. Consolidated net sales were $97."
1,"We measure, and actually our compensation programs have a measurement in there where the quality of the revenue is part of the measure. So, number one, to be compensated for it, to receive a commission for it, to count versus your objectives, it's got to qualify and meet those minimum profitability and margin thresholds before it even counts. So, there are definitely some very surgical-focused measures that specifically speak to quality revenue."
1,"We need to   we were interested in Carmike. One of the reasons was when we acquired the company, was the opportunity to deploy proven strategic initiatives that we've deployed in successfully in the AMC circuit. We really are just now beginning to do that."
1,"We need to invest in potential improvements to our technology, be it through partnerships or other opportunities that we have. And then, in terms of other opportunities out there, obviously, hard to comment and give you specifics there, but they need to essentially be aligned with our strategic priorities and focus and be also accretive to us from an overall growth standpoint. So nothing really has changed materially from what we've discussed before."
1,"We need to operate more efficiently in this area, which is why we've already taken these actions. In regards to other strategic initiatives we discussed, you've seen a series of announcements on our divestiture program over the last few months, which are outlined on slide 5. We've been making solid progress including completing the sale of our Philadelphia hospitals and signing the definitive agreement to sell Des Peres Hospital in St."
1,"We obviously are going to make all planned investments and that's contemplated even in this announcement. We'll continue to fund fully all of our value-creating opportunities and proper allocation for inorganic growth through M&A, which is an important part of our strategy. In terms of Plasma, we definitely feel we're going to be at the high-end of the range."
1,"We plan to again return at least 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders in 2018 through both dividends and share repurchases. We continue to make progress in the execution of our strategy and we recently announced the acquisition of Johnson Matthey's automotive battery systems business based in the UK, a subsidiary of Johnson Matthey that specializes in high-voltage automotive grade battery systems for electric and hybrid electric vehicles. The addition of Johnson Matthey Battery Systems technical expertise and customer base in markets that are more rapidly adopting electrification further strengthens our position, both as an electrified powertrain provider and as an energy storage supplier."
1,"We plan to invest about $11 million in 2018 to start the process. In addition to our strategic initiatives to drive organic growth, we remain committed to increasing stockholder value by actively deploying capital. We're confident in our business and future prospects and expect to accelerate capital deployment in 2018."
1,"We plan to remodel a minimum of three of these locations in 2018 that will transform their auditorium to majority of Premium Plus seats. Our second key strategic initiative is to open new iPic locations domestically. Today, we currently operate 115 screens at 15 locations in nine states."
1,"We planned to start mining Ã‡akmaktepe in Q4 2018 pending final approvals, trucking the ore down to the Ã‡Ã¶pler plant. Our strategy is to first start mining shallow ore in areas that are covered by forestry permits. This will produce about 50,000 ounces of recoverable gold, which will predominantly be produced in 2019."
1,"We put in bids on one or two and then effectively, we closed roughly one acquisition a year. And then over the longer term part of our strategy is to grow fee acquisitions roughly about 5% of revenue over the longer term, 5% per year."
1,"We realize the investors remain focus on our balance sheet and we will continue to work to opportunistically refinance our nearer term maturities in 2020 and 2021. Our focused operational strategy for each business segment has the overall objective to grow adjusted OIBDAR. And this, in conjunction with our balance sheet management efforts, will generate strong financial returns for our investors."
1,"We recently updated our total customer count to over 40,000 because several of you have asked about this and we will likely do this annually going forward. We have a lot to cover this morning and we want to get to your questions, so let's get started, progress that we've made against our four-point growth strategy. Our first strategy is to deliver integrated and open solutions in the cloud."
1,"We remain active in the evaluation of opportunities to expand our TAM through acquisition and internal product development. Our final strategic initiative is the focus on operational efficiency to strengthen the business and deliver improved profitability. Since we first introduced this initiative in 2014, you've heard us talk a lot about the transformational changes we are making in the business, driving us towards a more scalable operating model that creates efficiency and consistency in how we execute."
1,"We remain committed to considering any credible means to achieving this objective. The board believes the execution of our current strategic plan is the best path to maximize value at this time and the board is confident in the management's ability to grow revenue, create value and lead the global trade management industry as an independent company. After a thorough evaluation and diligent discussion of the E2open offer, the board of directors unanimously concluded that it is not in the best interests of the company stockholders to pursue E2open's proposed business combination whereby Amber Road would cease to operate as a publicly traded company."
1,"We remain committed to delivering our strategy to grow by investing in the structural opportunities in the budget hotel and coffee market, both in the UK and in internationally. We have increased the momentum in executing the strategic plan we set out in November 2016. We continue to innovate and growing our core UK markets for both Premier Inn and Costa."
1,"We remain confident to see double-digit growth in our Industrial sales in 2018. Before handing it over to Patrick, I'd like to remind you of our key three strategic priorities that form the pillars of our success. First, driving innovation and growth."
1,"We remain encouraged that the final policy will provide eligible Medicare beneficiaries with covered access to well-validated diagnostic tests like FoundationOne CDx. On today's call, I'll review several key highlights from 2017, provide insights into our 2018 strategic priorities and then turn the call over to Jason who will review our financial results and our 2018 guidance. To begin, clinical adoption remained strong throughout 2017."
1,"We remain focused on balanced growth, doubling down on Active and value, accelerating our progress in digital and customer experience, rationalizing non-performing real estate, and driving productivity. I want to close by pointing out something that I want to make very, very clear, and that is that the elements of our strategy and the impacts of tax reform, as they come together, they represent a material and persistent expansion of the earnings capacity of this company. Teri, let me turn it over to you."
1,"We remain focused on progressing with the expansion, which will enable us to significantly increase production capacity and continue to drive profitability gains. This is further supported by our solid cash flow generation and balance sheet, which provide us with a robust foundation to pursue our strategic initiatives. We are now ready to take questions."
1,"We remain laser focused on driving shareholder value in alignment with the expected industry growth, consumer demand and the potential in all the primary markets we serve in 2018 and beyond. We are well-positioned to continue to execute on our strategic plan and operational initiatives, and expect to further expand our product and geographic presence to be able to capitalize on the strengths of our platform. Additionally, our focus on acquisitions, capacity planning, talent retention and engagement, and increasing our product offering remains a high priority to continue to increase our value proposition to our customers."
1,"We reported an adjusted net loss of $196 million or $1. 06 per share, largely due to decisions aligned with our strategic priorities. On an adjusted basis, net income was $195 million."
1,"We repurchased $10 million worth of shares during the first quarter, and we recently declared a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend. We remain confident in our ability to deliver both strong consolidated net sales growth and conversion margin improvement for 2018, driven by healthy end markets and continued execution of our strategic initiatives. With that, I'll turn the call over to Martie."
1,"We retained $100 million in undrawn capacity on our variable funding notes. The fixed rate issuance to achieve our objectives of locking in favorable interest rates, staggering our debt maturities and ensuring that we can comfortably meet our operating capital return priorities over the medium and long-term. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1."
1,We saw combined sales jumping 15. 3% with our growth and expansion strategy delivering results. Australian domestic sales were up just over 12% and international sales overall were up 19.
1,"We saw some yield improvement coming into this year. But our strategy is to continue to generate cash flow, build coverage, reduce our leverage and these are some pretty phenomenal growth projects, and I think the last thing I would point out and that's why we spent so much time on 2. 0 today."
1,"We see an onshore market with a CAGR around 3% to 5%, so a stable market with a decent growth. Our strategic priorities in this market is as before, to generate best-in-class margin and to grow faster than the market. And that we do   will providing our customers with the lowest cost energy solutions."
1,"We see good residential mortgage loan origination volumes, which is bolstered by the continued traction of our expanded team in Kentucky and Southern Indiana. Moreover, our strategy to sell more of these originations on the secondary market is providing a nice lift to fee income. Our consumer portfolio which now represents approximately 5% of total loans, reflects our decision to reduce the risk profile through targeted reductions as it declined 14% year-over-year."
1,"We see this as an exciting opportunity for partnerships and there's a lot of structures that we've been seeing come to play with the half build to sell, half PPA models that we look to replicate. Solar does remain an important part of our long-term strategy. The recently implemented tariff, we believe it will have a short-term disruption to this market, but in the discussions that we've had with manufacturers, I really strongly believe that they will re-tool, they will move operations, do what they need to do and in the long-term, I think supply will remain robust and competitive."
1,"We see this time and time again in our own space. They're rationalizing their vendor landscapes very publicly down to a small number of partners, who they share roadmap with, they share their strategic priorities, and they expect you to step up and share your roadmap and your priorities with them. That trend has been happening in our industry."
1,"We should note though that given our Q1 results, it is unlikely we will achieve the three times net debt to segment profit milestone by the end of fiscal 2018. However, we plan to continue to invest in advancing our strategic priorities and our focus on improving our free cash flow over the prior year that will continue despite television advertising revenue headwinds. As well, we plan to maintain our cumulative dividend of a CAD 1."
1,"We still had to run after new capacities to be able to deliver the market, now we have them and we are delivering you can be sure. Also during the year and at the beginning of this year, we went on with our new partnerships and acquisitions to support our growth and clearly our value creation strategy. As you can see a few examples there, in the tire business you're all aware about the agreement and the partnership that we disclosed at the beginning of this year with TBC Corporation, which makes us a very, very strong player in the distribution sector in North America."
1,"We stopped the decline, and in Q4 we saw increasing total net subscribers, and we expect further growth in 2018, not only will this drive improvements in our content business, it will further push demand for our AgilePlans solutions. Our other major strategic initiative for mobile connectivity was a launch of our new high throughput satellite or HTS network, which we announced last November. This new global mini VSAT network went live in December, and is getting great reviews from our customers."
1,"We strongly believe this combination is the most attractive path forward for Newalta and we are committed to making the merger and ensuing integration success. Overall, I am very pleased with the execution of our core operating strategy, customer service and progress of our integrated solutions selling model, leveraging the unique attributes of our assets. I would like to thank you and at this point, Linda and I would now be pleased to take any questions you might have."
1,"We successfully integrated multiple acquisitions that doubled our asset base and continued to execute a best-in-class metrics on a significantly larger capital plan. Looking ahead to 2018, our strategy has not changed. We will continue to grow production within cash flow at industry-leading rates, with best-in-class cash margins and cost control."
1,"We talked to Al-Noor, Head of Digital is here, if you   we have to be good enough to partner with them. We have to have tools that can connect with data models, that can connect with   we have to be modern enough, but I think you'll see us over time, you'll see more partnerships laterally and things that are different than the model now because we can and because to them, they see us as a good business prospect for their long-term plans. And again, it goes back to is this a viable business?"
1,"We then developed a detailed strategy to do this, leveraging our industry leadership position and the uniquely attractive aspects of the landscaping wholesale distribution market. After three years of building the team, transforming the culture, and building the company, both organically and through acquisition, we are now more convinced than ever that our strategy is working and that it has enormous potential to deliver future performance and growth. Over the last three years, our efforts have also resulted in significant financial improvement."
1,"We then hit the   in the last three years, we made some decisions with our Board of Directors that were very strategic in positioning this company for long-term future growth. And when you look at 2015, 2016 and 2017, where you saw that earnings per share go dormant, it was very much given strategic initiatives to refine the portfolio to continue to improve the operating platform and invest in next gen and the go-forward business intelligence component which we think is critical to being competitive real estate company well into the next couple of decades. And also, in the de-levering from where we've typically been operating more in those low 40s to mid-40s down into 35s and so, those three years were very strategic in terms of the dilution that we knew we were taking through the aggressive dispose, the raising of capital as needed, and as Daniel said, the disconnect in that most of that growth was in development, and the timing mismatch in terms of when those assets and the revenue generation was coming on play."
1,"We think GKN's core eDrive technology portfolio will position Dana to capitalize on electrification opportunities across our light vehicle, commercial vehicle and off-highway end markets in these rapidly changing markets. I'm now going to talk to you about why we are convinced that this is such a great combination, how it fits into our strategy, and why we're well-established to execute the plan. There are four key strategic drivers underpinning this compelling combination, and later in the presentation, Jonathan will go into them in more detail."
1,We think these results are evident that the strategy to diversify earnings is working. Slide 28 provides you with a summary for 2017 and the last five years of how we've tackled the three strategic priorities. We've continued to work very hard on improving the efficiency of the operations and realized AUD 23 million in cost savings in 2017.
1,"We try to equate those hours to approximately what somebody would make if they were in another country. What we've added in conjunction which is strategy around training and education is we had a promotion to allow SPs to become eligible for paid training as a way to earn more a little earlier in the journey in conjunction with the strategy to have more educated and trained distributors everywhere. And so, it's a great   very exciting time in China for that reason."
1,"We understand that the ability to add significant value to the company will come from that in the shorter term. So mine life extensions in the region, additional ore in that Greater Doolgunna region is paramount at the top of our strategic plan. Number two is the completion of permitting, development, and taking into production the Black Butte Project in Montana will add significant value to the company."
1,"We view that this combination is both highly strategic as well as financially attractive. More specifically, to the opportunity we chose to pursue, we feel as though it's the best opportunity to further accelerate our strategy, further position us to be able to deliver affordable personalized solutions, it expands further our services framework, and as we noted in our prepared comments, we will establish an additional growth platform in the company a services vertical that takes the best of the broad specialty portfolio you would have known within Cigna, the broad capabilities you know within Express relative to supporting clients and customers and be in position to offer even a further suite to employers who want that health plans, governmental agencies, as well as high-performing value-based healthcare providers. So, we're really excited about the acceleration of our strategic journey and it's all around improving affordability and personalization for our customers and clients."
1,We want to continue to build our bank asset. And that really fits into our strategic plan of having the bank be the cornerstone that provide permanent financing for the mortgage company and utilizes the sweeps from the broker-dealer.
1,"We want to grow where we are underrepresented. Should specific opportunities present themselves in areas where we are underrepresented, we'll look at it with the same eyes that we have on the second strategic plan main target to grow organically. And therefore, the board will consider, as it is very clear on our dividend policy at the end of the year with all available information, what to do with excess capital that we'll have at that time."
1,We want to support them. But basically I would say that our clear strategy within this market is to keep on driving our full price revenues. What is clear for the environment will also determine how fast we can go in that direction.
1,"We want to thank those of you who attended our Las Colinas Investor Presentation at the beginning of NAREIT, in Dallas in November. We hope, we achieved our objective of demonstrating the execution of our strategic plan to own assets in high-quality submarkets, where job and rent growth is elevated, corporate presence is strong, amenities are abundant and were Piedmont can succeed based on our operating strengths, cost of capital and competitive advantages. Turning to the portfolio as first announced in Dallas, we entered into two binding contracts during the quarter to sell 14 properties which ultimately closed on January 4, 2018."
1,"We went from being a sub-$1 billion asset bank, focused primarily in New Jersey with a presence in Central and a little bit in Northern New Jersey, to a bank that improved its presence in both of those key markets as well as expanding into Bucks County and Southeastern Pennsylvania. We continue to drive economies of scale not only through prudent expense management, but also through our disciplined M&A strategy. And we saw meaningful profit improvement in margin enhancements throughout the year."
1,"We will also be pooling our expertise into global centers of excellence, removing areas of duplicated activity and maximizing our scale benefits. This will release $125 million of additional capacity for reinvestment into our strategic initiatives across IHG's P&L and the system funds by 2020. Our plan is that on an annual basis, the delivery of these savings matches the ramp-up of spend on the new initiatives."
1,"We will be a hub that will make their life simpler. So, all in all, these are our strategic priorities, our strategic priorities is to better serve our customers, which means to have or to continue having the positioning we currently have because this has shown that this is a useful differentiation indicator continue improving our processes and continue adapting our distribution model in order to better serve our customers and this is all very good and the strategy is very good and it's good to have a good strategy, but this has to be implemented, because only implementation will change the reality and only implementation creates value. And from that point of view, I think that at Bankia, I'm humble but I believe that we have demonstrated our execution power."
1,"We will continue the effective stewardship of our resources, ensuring we have the appropriate workforce as demand evolves and continuing to invest in the reliability of our locomotive fleet. Wrapping up on slide 27, at Norfolk Southern, we know we can deliver upon our strategic plan, focused on the core principles of safety, service, productivity and growth. As we head into 2018, we are optimistic about the current economic environment and I remain fully confident in our ability to deliver an operating ratio of sub-65% by 2020 or sooner, while delivering over $650 million in productivity savings."
1,"We will continue to build solid foundation and invest in product and technology in Hyperscale, Software Defined, Data Center and Networking. We remain confident in our long-term plan to return to profitable growth in our Data Center business. In Mobile business, we continue to see strong performance in our stronghold Latin America with nearly 40% revenue growth year-on-year, while maintaining good profitability."
1,"We will continue to firmly execute on synergies, realizing the cost benefits attached to the merger, much dedicated work remains and I recognize a lot of energy from my colleagues committed to the tasks and to the targets of the group. We remain convinced about our ability to deliver on our Intrum 2020 strategy and reach our three financial targets. Most importantly, an EPS uplift of 75% in 2020 compared to 2016."
1,"We will continue to follow our strategy, which has been successful over the past couple of years. The strategic priorities are listed on the left-hand side of our slide. We'll continue to drive customer focus of our organization."
1,"We will continue to increase our sales and revenue generation and further improve our efficiency. The new branch model will be complementing our digital strategy and supporting our medium-term cost to income ratio targeted at 33% to 35%. And now Ebru will share our performance in detail, after which we will be more than happy to answer your questions."
1,"We will continue to invest in our people, processes, and technology as collectively these generate outstanding results for our customers and returns for our shareholders. Corporate development and acquisitions have been and will be an important part of our future strategy. Over the last several years, we've spent over $1."
1,"We will continue to monitor the impact of additional interpretations or guidance on these judgments. For American Water, the most important takeaway from tax reform is that over the next five years, our fundamental investment strategy does not change. We continue to see a 7% to 10% long-term compound annual growth rate in EPS, and our EPS CAGR with tax reform is accretive or even stronger than our plan before tax reform."
1,"We will continue to raise our dividend in the foreseeable future at a high single-digit, double-digit pace and we will continue to buy shares to maintain our share count. So the wildcard frankly is what we are able to source in the M&A arena that can use that very strong balance sheet and cash on the balance sheet for growth and advancing our strategic initiatives in our 2020 Vision."
1,We will continue to utilize technology to efficiently extract these metals from various fields. Nearly 18 months have passed since the unveiling of 5N21 strategic plan and we believe a number of key performance indicators suggest plan is working. Gross margins across the business expressed in percentage of revenue and absolute value have grown markedly.
1,"We will do so by maintaining our cost discipline and by redeploying the efficiency gains we will generate from technology-enabled productivity improvements. Our largest ever strategic investment will focus on three main areas, all of which will support our GSR3 strategic priorities, technology, people and data. In GSR2, we built the UK's largest digital bank."
1,"We will expand margins and leverage our assets in SG&A spend more efficiently, providing more funds to accelerate growth. In addition, our expansive VIP projects will become a world-class supply chain company as we are undertaking a major multi-year sourcing engagement that is designed to reduce our nearly $2 billion of bill and material spend by well over $200 million annually by the end of our strategic planning period. This is very hard work worth doing required for us to achieve our 15% compound annual earnings growth."
1,"We will expand our overall product offerings to ensure our sellers outside the United States have access to more of the Square ecosystem, as you saw with our recent launches of our contactless and chip card reader and interact acceptance in Canada, Square Stand in Australia, and JCP acceptance in Japan. We will also improve automated onboarding and strengthen our go-to-market strategy. We're moving forward in 2018 with strong momentum and a focus on creating more services, more value and more trust with our customers."
1,"We will focus on food safety, quality and execution. We will be focused and decisive as we execute our strategic plan. We will focus on long-term value creation and we will make decisions with a long-term focus even if those decisions do not maximize near-term earnings."
1,"We will focus the Byggmax segment in 2018 increasingly towards growth with the ambitious plans that we have to grow this business, and we will focus SkÃ¥nska Byggvaror on the transformation that is now initiated. All in all, page 27, we are pleased that the implementation of our new strategic plan is on track and starting to give positive effects. We are pleased that the underlying Byggmax business is developing positively also in the quarter with increased sales, market share and profitability."
1,"We will give an update on the GEA transformation, where do we stand with the system, the processes integrations, and the IT. We will also give an outlook on the ongoing strategic initiatives which go beyond Fit for 2020 and OneGEA such as the global manufacturing footprint, where we in the next coming weeks are going to take some very important milestones forward on the procurement initiative which we have launched internally besides the normal supply chain saving initiatives which people have been doing every year to counteract cost increases and service push. Then some ideas on portfolio initiatives and further efficiency increases particularly and especially the SG&A."
1,"We will have an update on our future plans in the fourth quarter of 2018. As you know well, our strategic plan ends up in 2018 and we are already starting to work on the next strategic plan for the period 2018 to 2021, which we will be updating and presenting in the fourth quarter of the year. That's all from me for the time being and we can move on to the Q&A."
1,"We will high grade our portfolio that means we will make sure that the customers, the geographies and the products and services all make sense from a profitability standpoint. In my first 100 days on the job, I led a process to develop a strategic plan with the goal of maximizing our revenue and profitability. First we took steps internally to better align our business lines under clear and accountable leadership."
1,"We will initially focus on advancing our four late-stage programs, while continuing to leverage our discovery engines to advance new targets. We have a seasoned team with complementary experience and financial resources to execute our strategy. With that, I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."
1,We will invest $2. 5 billion of this cash back into the business in support of the strategic initiatives we outlined at our Investor Conference. We will also use this cash to pay $4.
1,"We will maintain a competitive pricing across our network of schools to further drive organic growth of our business. Business in the operation front, we continue to progress on important strategic initiatives to expedite expansion and drive profitable growth. And I would like to update you before handing over to Dora to discuss the financial results of the quarter in more details."
1,"We will not be restating 2017 results and there will not be any impact to cash flow. Turning to slide 9, we are implementing several strategic initiatives to drive market share growth. First, we maintained our selectively reduced customer air fees implemented during the third quarter of 2017 to drive cross-selling of higher margin packages and hotels, as well as customer acquisitions."
1,"We will outsource more non-core activities, introduced increased levels of automation, and pool our expertise into global centers of excellence, removing areas of duplicated activity and maximizing our scale benefits. This will release $125 million of additional capacity for reinvestment into our strategic initiatives, across IHG's P&L and the system fund by 2020. These actions are designed to drive industry-leading net rooms growth over the medium-term."
1,"We will provide more specifics for you when we introduce fiscal 2019 annual guidance on our next earnings call. In conclusion, we were pleased with our third quarter performance and remain focused on executing our strategic plans to deliver long-term growth for Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo. Now I will turn the call back over to John for closing remarks."
1,"We will remain focused on exercising great care in ensuring that we create shareholder value by optimizing our capital structure, by preserving the flexibility to pursue our growth strategy. We will continue to consider and evaluate all relevant capital allocation strategies that will match the pursuit of our growth strategy, and we continue to review each prospect accordingly to our value creation standards. Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks."
1,"We will review part of the projects in the company based on return on investment capital and we'll see either we should slightly decrease probably our investments into vertical integration, not to put them on hold, but ROIC wise, we'll try to deliver more value for investors trying to make our investments more efficient. Anyway, by the end of April, we'll probably during the roadshow   by the end of the first quarter, we'll try to deliver the new plan and new strategic initiatives to be done by the company by the end of this year. That's what we are up for now."
1,"We will therefore continue to roll our prepays and further look at options to refinance our 2019 maturities; namely, the â‚¬350 million high-yield bond maturing September of 2019. So with that, I will now hand over the presentation back to Hilmar for some concluding remarks on our 2018 strategic priorities."
1,"We will turn our attention from cost reductions to growing the company's top line both organically and through accretive acquisitions, to increase our scale, improve our margins, adjusted EBITDA and ultimately return to profitability. We believe crisp execution of our strategic plan will enable us to deliver enhanced shareholder value. I'll now hand the call over to Roger to review the financial details then come back with some additional comments."
1,"We will, therefore, significantly increase our investment in developing in-house capabilities and increase training hours by over 50% compared to the previous plan, focusing on the key skills our workforce will need for the future. Importantly, our strategic plan will also deliver greater value for our shareholders. While we are targeting this significant increase of 40% in our strategic investments to over Â£3 billion over the planned period, we will achieve a net reduction in our cost base to less than Â£8 billion in 2020."
1,"We wish to draw the market into a new game, one that we stumbled upon that we think will be transformative for all. There are three fundamentally unique capabilities at athenahealth, around which we build most of our strategy. The first is that nobody can open the network of medical information like athenahealth."
1,"We worked well as a team. We strengthened our culture and advanced our key strategic initiatives. You'll recall these five key strategic initiatives are around increasing same-store sales, increasing conversion rates, scaling our adjusted operating margin, having more friends, referrals, and existing members adding more pets, all with the goal of offsetting churn or our version of Nirvana, and the fifth automating payments of veterinary invoices."
1,"We would   look, we're always considering the opportunity to refinance the bonds and so we'll sort of take everything into account as to when would be the appropriate time to do that. Or frankly when we look at our long-term plans, we have other ways that we can refund   can refinance the bonds. I think the key thing to realize here, Matt, is that our credit metrics are going to improve dramatically as a result of the acquisition."
1,"We would like you to invite you to three breakout sessions hosted by the business and transformation leads. This will take place in smaller groups, and you will have the opportunity to hear more about each of our strategic priorities and ask questions to the team that will deliver the transformation. After a short lunch break, George will then present our financial projections and targets before AntÃ³nio provides some closing thoughts on our strategic plan."
1,"We would really like strategically to enhance our presence in the Permian. It's one of our strategic initiatives. But as you mentioned, it's very highly competitive out in that area."
1,"We'll also be continuing with our portfolio high-grading, both organically and non-organically with capital allocation discipline across every investment decision in the divisions and the Group portfolio. The plan for the year and the strategic plan are on track. Thanks very much for listening, and be delighted to take any questions along with John."
1,"We'll be able to drive some degree of NOI growth better we think than some of the substandard portfolio. So, I think our strategy has always been to build a portfolio that will outperform over the long-term. And when you build bigger, newer higher quality buildings, you get better credit tenants that do longer lease term, so you have less default risk, you have less rollover, you have less CapEx that had to go with the building."
1,"We'll continue to push the envelope here, and I expect the coming year to mark an important step forward in continuing to develop enterprise grade analytics platform capabilities. As we look ahead to 2018, we'll be focused on several strategic priorities and areas of investments. First, continuing to execute crisply on our subscription transition by helping our customers renew and expand their Tableau footprint as their analytic demands grow."
1,"Well done and congratulations to you and your retirement, and my special thanks for helping me transition in the new role. In 2018, we're focusing on several strategic initiatives that will help improve our overall company performance as referenced on slide 6. First, we'll increase our technical understanding of the reservoir system through integration of 3D seismic, core and other data gathering initiatives with the goal of drilling longer laterals and optimal target windows."
1,"We'll get the core business from 8% to 11%, as you see. And then our capital strategy through, again, through things like share repurchase, M&A and things will get us another 4% to 5% getting us into the 12% to 16% overall. And there's probably some additional upside obviously for the takeaway box there."
1,"We'll have a strong focus in the future on innovation and automation as we move Red Lake into the future. So, what's the strategic plan for Red Lake Gold Mines, 20/20/20 vision? Red Lake is now in a growth mode."
1,"We'll have strong cash generation providing the business flexibility and the ability to quickly de-lever. And the businesses are operating aggressively implementing strategic plans to accelerate growth around the core and current and new customers with product and service expansion and operationally pursuing continuous improvement and how we link with our suppliers to reduce redundancy cost and improve our overall margins. We know we can continue to drive shareholder value via our business execution, strategic investments that we'll make around technology and acquisitions, and returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases."
1,"Well look as far as we're concerned, we really have very limited Activewear current volume today. So I mean really it's been very difficult for us to actually drive our brand strategy in Activewear and I think truthfully is, is that there is an opportunity for us, if we engage in retailer private label and some of those categories where we think it will fit our criteria that our programs, that are large scale, have good returns and meet our manufacturing capabilities. I mean there's definitely an opportunity to gain further sales as we go forward."
1,"We'll look for other areas where we think we need to adjust and during the good times, with a view that we'll have lower volatility through cycles and continue. So, as we advance the strategic plan, the emphasis is on core, not M&A, and that's our focus."
1,"We'll share further details as 2018 progresses. Shifting to our organizational efforts, we recently announced we've undertaken several steps to fund the strategic priorities I just outlined. As I stated on our Q3 earnings call, we'd first focus on internally funding these investments by reallocating funds within our current cost structure, and we've done just that by identifying approximately $45 million in annualized adjusted EBITDA cost savings to put towards these efforts."
1,"We'll talk more in depth about both of these later in the call. We're excited about our new digital strategy and its potential to create value for our workers, clients, and shareholders. The changes we made in 2017 with respect to our brand structure and our digital strategy have helped us solidify our position as a leader for filling contingent and permanent positions."
1,"We'll then open the call up for questions. We are pleased with our performance in the second quarter, with results that reflect the completion of the Boyd's acquisition, as well as the continued execution of our strategy, which we believe is creating a solid platform for growth. We continue to see both organic and inorganic growth opportunities and remain focused on leveraging the investments we have made in our roasting facilities, expanding our distribution network, adding new customers and increasing business with existing customers."
1,"We'll work with Marie Cheval because there's still a lot of work to be done, especially at the digital level. So, we need to overhaul our strategy. But this will be decided of course with the local teams."
1,"Well, again, Olivia, I guess I would just remind everyone that one of the hallmarks of our 2020 Strategy and what we've done successfully over the last couple of years is, we've significantly stepped up consumer demand building investments. You look at our fixed capital investments, that's been stepped up to support both growth and cost savings."
1,"Well, as we've always said, we've said, Horacio said that, part of our Vision 2020 strategy is to accelerate our growth, in particular revenue ex-billables. And we look at revenue ex-billables because that to us is the best indicator of the productivity of our people."
1,"Well, as we've said before, this will be part of the new strategic plan, cost, targets, et cetera. But the recent liability management transactions and the results of the transactions of last year make us believe that this reduction can continue."
1,"Well, I don't know if I would ever say turn the corner because it's a huge long-term plan, but we're seeing incredible improvement in the game. We're very excited about what we're seeing, but it's been on the roadmap that we've been talking about, the similar roadmap that Madden followed, a two to three-year improvement cycle in the game where we're constantly updating and building better and better events around for the players."
1,"Well, I just want to thank everybody for joining us on this call and we are continuing to be optimistic about the strategic plan that we laid out and we'll continue to update you on the progress that we are making in each component of that strategic plan. Thank you so much for joining us."
1,"Well, I think the strategic priorities going forward are continuing to drive Visa to be a digital company, making sure that we get the most out of the Europe acquisition as we possibly can, making sure that we continue to expand access. There still are 2 billion people, by our estimates, in the world that don't play in the mainstream financial system."
1,"Well, I would start by saying business development remains a significant priority for us as we think about   you asked earlier about this situation with JANUVIA going off-patent. It's an important issue for us as we try to grow the company long term, but our business development philosophy is based on our overall strategy, which is we're looking to bring great drugs to market. And so, what we're trying to do is we're trying to find those opportunities through licensing and bolt-on acquisitions to acquire the kinds of science that will lead us to great drugs that will be differentiated and make a meaningful impact on unmet medical need."
1,"Well, it's still part of our strategy, John, in the UK. There would be similar-sized businesses to what we have acquired in the last 18 months or so."
1,"Well, John, I think the financial services team in all three countries continue to do a great job of executing on our strategy and clearly, this quarter's performance was record setting. We are moving forward."
1,"Well, Jon, we always look at things, but the priority for us in 2018 is getting the strategic plan process really robustly and well completed, and then secondarily, making sure we deliver these revenue metrics. We've been saying for several years we think we're in late innings."
1,"Well, just thank you everybody for joining us today. We look forward to 2018, and continuing to drive aggressively forward on our strategy. Andrew?"
1,"Well, let me now run through the agenda and the speakers today. We'll start with Jean-Yves Charlier, our CEO, who is going to go through the 2017 achievements and our 2018 strategic priorities. We'll then have Trond Westlie, our CFO, run through the 2017 financial results and the 2018 targets."
1,"Well, once the possibility of dramatic tax reform just a few months ago has now become reality and one which we believe creates even greater opportunity for Bank of Hope to enhance its shareholder value. Now, I would like to take a few minutes to discuss just a couple of our strategic priorities for 2018. First, core deposit gathering will be a key priority for Bank of Hope this year, and I suspect it will be for many of our peer banks."
1,"Well, Ravi, I think the strategic initiative that we have with Walmart's built upon a shared goal of providing customers convenience and value. And that really makes   both of us can save time and money as Chairman talked about."
1,"Well, thank you very much, everyone for all of your thoughtful questions. As I hope you can tell, I'm excited to be here at Anthem, and the opportunity to advance our strategic priorities to create a health care system that's more affordable and simpler. As I outlined earlier, we'll be focused on optimizing execution across our business and ensuring that we leverage our unique assets to strategically position the company for sustainable, high quality earnings growth."
1,"Well, thanks Susan. So, we continue to focus on the key strategic initiative we've talked about in the past of really accelerating our pace of growth through opening new restaurants across the country, particularly in the Ontario and QuÃ©bec markets. So, 45 new A&W restaurants opened across the country in 2017, 27 of which were in Ontario and QuÃ©bec."
1,"Well, the first question I'd like to start with is as we're in a new year, is to learn about your operating and your strategic priorities for 2018. But you've also put out the results from some of the fourth quarter metrics this morning."
1,"Well, the first question on cash flow generation, that's the main focus of our short-term strategy to grow the cash flow of this company, to make sure that we have significant headroom to finance solid dividends, together with de-leveraging the company and financing for organic growth. We are delivering on that."
1,"Well, the wonderful thing about everything we're doing with our strategy is, we're utilizing the assets that we have now, whether that's people, our manufacturing plants and stuff like that. So the resource we will add will probably be technical people for the most part, so that we can touch the client based on a broader scale."
1,"Well, this is not information we can communicate now to the market. Maybe in the strategic plan, we can go into further detail, but we clearly believe in our improvement due to all of the reasons explained, but we are now in no position to quantify this."
1,"Well, to the latter, no. I mean, our strategy is always to be very competitive, and if we have to be more competitive, we will. We feel we're very competitive on the things that we're doing."
1,"Well, when we looked to the future that's   what I mentioned was in the strategic plan, that's our plan to do that."
1,"Well, yes. We will see all of this in detail in the strategic plan. But I would like to say first that demand in Asia has consolidated this push, which we started seeing in the previous year, in the last quarter."
1,"We're absolutely committed to doing what we can to keep telling the stories important to Canadians and communities across our country as we transition to a new business model. Looking ahead, we will continue to look for savings and explore every aspect of revenue generation in our evolving business strategy. For a closer look at the results for the quarter, I'll pass it over to our CFO, Brian Bidulka."
1,"We're also encouraged by the momentum of our Choice program and our Sequoia activity, as well as the strong underlying credit performance of our investment portfolio. We feel we have positioned our operating platform to scale profitably going forward and can augment that growth through some of our new strategic initiatives in 2018. Finally, before I turn it over to Dash, I'd like to personally invite all of our investors to our inaugural Investor Day, which will be on March 6 in New York City."
1,We're also focusing on specific programs to support and strengthen relationships with Costco as well as with the Amazon as the market shifts towards online sales. Another key part of our strategy includes reinvigorating relationships with legacy customers by better understanding their needs and providing appropriate product offerings. These former customers represent an exciting and significant opportunity for MusclePharm under the leadership of Mark Johnson.
1,"We're also pleased to report that the integration of the Hausmann acquisition, which we executed in April of last year continues to proceed very well, and the division is contributing positively to our consolidated operating results. These two acquisitions have been positive first steps in executing our strategy to grow by acquisition. Consistent with the direction we gave in November, we expect to operate at an annualized rate of approximately $65 million to $70 million in sales, and we believe we will generate positive cash flow from operations."
1,"We're also seeing good demand for our ABL offering, where we've invested to expand our distribution capabilities. Extending into new markets and products that fit with our model and risk appetite has always been an integral part of our strategy. But we do this slowly and with patience."
1,"We're always focused on overall sales productivity. Obviously, our strategy is to align our sales resources by customer type and there's three main groups that we   I'd like to speak with you about today. Number one is the National Account Managers."
1,"We're built to deliver superior outcomes to our patients and are investing in the future through meaningful research. Our strategy is to attain market leadership in neuromodulation, combining our differentiated product coupled with continued commercial execution while simultaneously laying the groundwork for long-term growth via our unique commitment to Level 1 clinical work. We remain committed to sustainable growth by leveraging the Nevro brand in future category expansion initiatives."
1,"We're committed to doing that in partnership with our customers. For 2018, we'll continue to focus on and execute our four key strategic priorities, and I feel really good about our plans. We'll continue to expand our business in EMEA, APAC, and will accelerate investment in LATAM and Canada, bringing more resources closer to our customers and launching direct-to-consumer advertising in some markets like Canada for the first time."
1,"We're confident in our plans, and we're in a strong position to move forward. We have a robust balance sheet, no debt, and we plan to fund our ongoing strategic initiative, development, and investments in the business entirely with internally generated funds with no need for external financing. And with that, I'll pass you back to Randy who'll take you through our broader strategic growth plans that accompany these numbers for both 2018 and beyond."
1,"We're confident we can sustain momentum into the coming years. We believe that executing our strategic initiatives will allow us to continue to enhance the customer experience which will, in turn, lead to growth and improved profitability. As such, we'll continue to strive for double-digit EPS growth over the next three years."
1,"We're currently looking for properties in Milton Keynes area and we hope to find a building we can buy and renovate during this fiscal year, and we look forward to keeping you updated on this exciting project in the coming months. Strategic initiative number five is operational excellence. Our goal under this initiative is best summarized by one of our core values here at WD-40 Company, make it better than it is today."
1,"We're focusing on our other three business segments, but Engineered Materials   as a matter of fact, I would point to the fact that we continue investments in new formulations, new products. We are undertaking quite a strategic initiative at one of our facilities to drive an Industry 4. 0 type process improvement, complete controls of an existing facility that will drive further efficiencies and improvement."
1,"We're fully committed to the transformation of our business to position Manulife as a digital customer-centric leader. We're confident that by delivering on our strategic priorities, we will succeed in delighting our customers, exciting and engaging our employees and creating substantial shareholder value. Before I pass it off to Phil, I wanted to take a deeper dive into two areas of focus, portfolio optimization and accelerating our businesses with the most potential."
1,"We're going to change the format a little bit today, with me providing the introduction and turning it over to Connie, to go through the financial results, then Matt will update us on his initiatives and the activities since joining Nortech, then I'll close and open it up for questions. Just to introduce Connie, Connie joined us in January, previously was Vice President of Finance and Controller for MOCON, where in addition to her public company reporting requirements, she helped supports strategic planning in international multi-site operations. Her financial experience and operation expertise makes Connie an excellent fit here and it's already showing in the short-time with us."
1,"We're going to continue to focus on positive operating leverage going forward. And as Steve mentioned also, we're just kicking off our strategic planning process where we're evaluating different opportunities to grow the business. The primary focus of that process is on revenue growth and thinking about the customer and thinking about what we can do to improve customer experience."
1,"We're headed into 2018 with a road that couldn't be more clear. Our strategy is working. Our guests are responding, and we're accelerating the pace, pushing even harder, moving faster than ever before."
1,"We're headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah with 84 employees. So, some of the strategic priorities for the bank this year. We want to continue to reinforce the strategic partner business and assist our partners in funding both on balance sheet and off balance sheet which we were doing through the held-to-maturity side of an asset management."
1,"We're looking to do that with other hybrid OR players as well. And as I mentioned in my comments, Mike, in addition to some new products and focusing on surgical efficiency partnering with the IMRISs of the world and others with whom they compete, has been and will continue to be an important strategic initiative to continue to drive the growth we've seen in surgical. We haven't talked a lot about surgical this morning, but we had another great quarter there globally with a 6% growth in our surgical business on top of   I think it's about 6%, 7% last year core growth."
1,"We're particularly pleased with the delta between our GAAP EPS and non-GAAP EPS has narrowed significantly over the past few years, signaling that we've been making the right strategic moves on our transformation journey to generate increasing returns to our shareholders. We're now three years into our five-year transformation strategy and our results for the quarter and the year demonstrate that we've made tremendous progress both operationally and financially. Since 2014, we've improved annual GAAP EPS from a loss of $2."
1,"We're placing the customer experience at the center of all decision making from the architectural design and the ambience of the extraordinary places recreate to the digital touch points that our customers engage and interact with, to providing world-leading retailers and concierge services. These strategic priorities and investments will strengthen Scentre Group's position as the owner and operator of the retail property portfolio whereby customers and retailers want to be, enabling business to provide our security holders with strong long-term risk adjusted total returns. I will now open the call to questions."
1,"We're pleased to be with you to review the progress we made with the business in 2017, and why we look forward to another productive year in 2018. Our efforts at ImmunoGen start with a focused commitment in four strategic priorities. First, complete the development and launch mirvetuximab for the treatment of women with ovarian cancer by 2020; second, accelerate our pipeline of novel IGN program; third, build on our leadership position in ADCs through continued innovation; and fourth, expand the reach of our innovation and maintain financial strength through partnering."
1,"We're probably spending more time at my team and with the board on that exact question. As I mentioned in my comments, we're right in the middle of our strategic planning process and no conclusions right now, but we're looking at both sides of that, Ron We definitely want to get our operations moving effectively and consistently, and so we've really been focused on that. But at the board level and at the strategic planning level, we're spending quite a bit of time as we speak right now."
1,"We're rapidly moving towards a product launch and securing integration and distribution partners. By the end of third quarter of financial year 2018, Medibio expects to release its board approved strategic plan alongside its updated general market presentation. Some of you in the market have been saying you've not heard enough from me, which I'm pretty surprised."
1,"We're scheduled to complete about 220 in the second half and that's purely a function of project timing and staging and when stages come to completion. That's important as development's a key driver of growth in returns for us and a key element of our strategy. Also this year, and we've spoken about this before, we've certainly started the planning process on some of our existing villages."
1,"We're strong in these areas and I believe that's going to be the foundation of our growth. For medical customers, we're looking at more strategic initiatives that add economies of scale including value driven services and sourcing within our global operations. In the coming years, we anticipate offering certified medical manufacturing facilities at any custom   for any customer worldwide."
1,"We're taking a little less price this year, we take a little more price in high-speed data, a little bit less in video as you see through some of the market takes that you all have. But again, bring it all back to   we think we've got a very effective product in the marketplace and our aggregation strategy around content. In a world where people are consuming more video than ever and it's again the best reason for having our broadband product."
1,"We're using our expertise to invest in the best possible content and to secure the best possible return. We are two years into the five-year strategic plan we laid out to you at our Investor Day in 2016, and we're exceeding our commitment to you. This includes a 2018 that will be another record with a back half that will be even stronger than the first."
1,"We're very excited about our demonstrated results and the incremental opportunities we have to grow in this important channel that's also growing overall. To drive our strategic plan, we'll continue to invest in our brands through advertising, product diversification and innovation, and in our warehouse go-to-market capability to enable growth. So let's move on to our second key takeaway area, our enterprise-wide productivity plan."
1,"We're very pleased with how we performed in 2017. We're delivering on our strategic plan and believe we have the right team, platform and business model to continue to create significant value for our shareholders. With that, I'll hand it back to Sandro."
1,We're very pleased with this progress and excited about the potential for this key growth platform. We are very pleased with the fourth quarter and the full year results as we remain confident in our ability to execute our long-term strategic plan and maximize opportunities provided by the macro trends for both of our business segments. This concludes my initial remarks.
1,"We're working on in our tech centers around the world, the next generation media specifications for our customers to build upon already super strong customer relationships that we've got. And channel and distribution, this is a very active part of our growth strategy and this kind of expands our relationship with our distributors as the primary supplier where we might have been a second tier before. We've also been able to displace the competition."
1,We've already come up with some important insights from our strategic and operational review. Our strategy is aimed at the right markets. Our data is unique and vital to our customers.
1,"We've already filled close to 200 roles ahead of our plan, enabling the center to deliver elements of work across five major functions and some of our core end-to-end processes, including purchase-to-pay, sales order to cash, and hire to retire. We also launched a global engagement program to equip our employees with the knowledge and the tools required to deliver our strategic priorities. Finally, turning to guidance."
1,"We've also begun appropriate pre-commercial activities. These include initiating the manufacturing of commercial material, preparing the supply chain for scale-up, strengthening our network of thought leaders and patient advocates, building disease awareness to support the proper diagnosis of ES, defining our go-to-market strategy, and recruiting additional medical affairs and commercial talent to ensure a successful launch. Our FL and DLBCL programs, of course, are also an important area of focus for the team."
1,"We've also had new patents issue recently related to DDR4, RDIMM and LRDIMM. In summary, we are focused on the execution of our strategic initiatives including building demand for EV and NV and the continued commercialization of HybriDIMM. The expanding markets for hybrid memory and storage-class memory provides numerous opportunities to deliver value from our products and intellectual property."
1,"We've been doing that   again, we talked about on the earnings call, we talked about the fact that we weren't able to get to the finish line with the processes we were ongoing. We continue to look at opportunities specific to our strategy and the areas that we could think we can invest to win in those four areas in particular that Jim noted. And then to the extent that there are times when we believe there's market dislocations and an understanding of what we're going to do longer over the longer period and our internal DCF and intrinsic value, there's enough cushion there."
1,"We've been getting orders from the customer and we have been honoring those purchase orders received from this customer, and we continue to manufacture methadone for them. Nasrat will be giving an update on all the products development that's going on in Elite which will give you an insight into contract manufacturing's decreasing role in Elite's long-term strategic plans. But in the near-term, contract manufacturing is important to us."
1,"We've been reporting record results. We've strengthened our balance sheet, restructured our pension plans and created value through our continuous commitment to our strategic initiatives to drive down our cost structure and debt levels. More importantly, despite our success to date, we do not plan to let up and we will continue to focus on cost control and invest in tools and technology to better and more effectively serve our customers, which is absolutely essential to our global champion strategy."
1,"We've been reporting record results. We've strengthened our balance sheet, restructured our pension plans and created value to the continued improvement or commitment to our strategic initiatives to drive down our cost structure and debt levels. More importantly, despite our success to-date, we do not plan letting up and we will continue to focus on cost control and invest in tools and technology to better more efficiently serve our customers which is essential to our global champion strategy."
1,"We've committed to being transparent, keeping our customers and owners appraised of our products and through our actions, building trust. Security is a top priority for Intel, foundational to our products and it's critical to the success of our data-centric strategy. Our near-term focus is on delivering high-quality mitigations to protect our customers' infrastructure on these exploits."
1,"We've completed comprehensive roadmap for the platform, data science approach, and applications development. This roadmap drives our strategy of agile development and kicked off our product development cadence, and release versioning. Our team is still being assembled, while development of both the platform and products are in development to production stage."
1,"We've created retail commercial and purpose built rental into our developments, and we received major approvals with almost all remaining land expected to be approved in the next 18 months. We internalized the management contract to Dream Office and managed through a strategic plan. We increased our ownership among our group from 2% percent to 21%."
1,We've got a great installed base there. And now it's a matter of executing stage two and stage three of our strategy. And then the last piece is the strong cash generation.
1,"We've got a really full pipeline looking going into 2018 right now. And our strategy is very consistent. First, we're looking to buy title agencies where they make sense to us and then we look to buy some technology plays to help our data and automate the titling process."
1,"We've got a strong technology proposition. So, as well as just selling the platform, we're able to say to our clients or potential clients, look, we can help you build your shareowner strategy. We can help you change the way you interact with your investor base, we can help shape that."
1,We've got Amplify that we have a lot of confidence in. So we continue to feel good about our ability to get to that long-term sales guidance over our strategic planning horizon.
1,"We've got organic growth accelerating this year off of last year. And the strategic initiatives we talked about around our two largest sales we're very optimistic about. So we're really looking forward to continuing this dialogue in 2018, we'll see you on the roads."
1,"We've hosted our inaugural Investor Day in December. Our senior leadership team laid out a detailed roadmap of our strategic priorities, how our operations are designed to facilitate our One Bank approach and how we are leveraging technology and analytics to improve the customer experience. The strength of our balance sheet and earnings allowed us to raise our quarterly dividend by $0."
1,"We've not seen any clear evidence. And, of course, money is spongeable, so, if somebody were to make an investment, the motivation to drive that, whether it was driven by tax or it was driven by other things they're seeing in their business or their strategic plans, so, at that point I think it's really a fungeable conversation. So, as we think about it is, is we wanted to ensure that we thought about it in our guidance and incorporated the flexibility to do that."
1,"We've put a number of important governance pieces in place in terms of how we think about capital, how we govern and how we make decisions. I think it starts with being clear on what our strategy is and what is the portfolio you want aligned with that strategy and being clear where you want more or less exposure. And I think we've done a very good job in the last couple of years bringing clarity to that."
1,"We've read a lot of stuff about it and they're moving forward quite quickly. I think their long-term plan is to produce the methanol from coal in India to service that demand. So, probably, if there was any demand drivers that would be shorter term and not a lot, I think they will gradually ramp it up."
1,"We've realized, we have made significant long-term investments to get us to a leadership position in a tough space. But, we're seeing very early signs in 2018 that our strategy is working, more on that later this year. Moving to the investment management business, we ended the year with $11 billion of assets under management, which is an increase of $459 million from January of 2017."
1,"We've seen this approach pay off over the last two years, as we've enhanced and grown our forever franchises into the strongest mobile portfolio in company history. Our bold beat strategy is designed to deepen engagement with our existing players, bring back lapsed players and attract new players to our franchises. For Zynga, bold beats include new features, new systems and new content such as global licenses and strategic partnerships that enhance the player experience."
1,"We've set an aggressive 2018 agenda, and our focus is on getting it done. We have the right strategic plan and a strong team in place to drive our business and our company forward. So with that, I'd like to open up the call for your questions."
1,"We've started together as a leadership team to look at kind of a specific view of the next three years. And with the thought of trying to take a look at some of these key topics, developing a more detailed three-year strategic plan to drive focus on how we execute. And so kind of as I noted here, and you'll see in the graphic, this includes reviewing priorities for our investments, refining our strategies and identifying opportunities to optimize the business."
1,"We've stood up a variant of our technology within the Amazon Cloud Volumes service, that is a NetApp offered service, it's a NetApp third-party service, as opposed to the relationship that we have with Azure which is quite unique, and we expect that we'll have more announced very shortly beyond those two, that gives us a broader reach to enterprise customers in the market overall. So, I think in theory, what I would say is, our strategy, as a company, is to be a leading technology provider to the biggest clouds in the world. The cloud companies themselves are quite different by, you know, physical location and environment that they run within, and you know interested in partnering with a company like NetApp in some cases, and we'll maximize the opportunity as best we can across all of them, knowing that those differences do exist."
1,"We've talked about the FAA as an example. If you take a look at the 8 or 10 civilian agencies that have significant deployed physical assets, you take a look at the Veterans Administration, you take a look at the Postal Service, and you can go on and on, every one of those agencies in their strategic plan which is all public   it's all on their websites   talk about the diversification of how they support that physical infrastructure, taking advantage of the converging physical and digital infrastructure, potentially privatizing some of how those assets are maintained over time. So, we're in the final stages now of our plan to take us 2019 and beyond, and we will talk very publicly about the types of markets that we are going to take our core competencies in today, continue to expand what we do today in the military, but take what we do to other markets as well."
1,"We've worked very hard to achieve this and we're not willing to sacrifice sales coverage and reduce investments in new products and a means to offset short-term margin pressures. However, we have implemented off-cycle price increases, driving cost control, and actively managing the portfolio to mitigate margin pressures without compromising our strategic plan. I'd also like to take the opportunity to welcome Jeff Schmaling, our new President of our Consolidated Industrial and Energy Segment."
1,"What we've done previously is, first, discuss the top line data at conferences and then dig further into the individual subsets and secondary endpoints. When we have those specific meetings and so forth, we certainly share those as part of our communication strategy."
1,"When it comes to the recycled fiber, indeed and as we've said, we have seen some benefits from imported recycled fiber. And as such, we continue to develop our strategy to take advantage of that, although we haven't seen that benefit from national recycled fibers which have been a negative on the cost side. So we are, of course, rearranging or balancing our strategy to make sure we're buying in the most efficient way in terms of recycled and also virgin fiber."
1,"When we see those prices, we're able to go out and get them. I think your question on gas was what was our strategy? We were not seeing the prices in the backend of the year with the backwardation that would have gotten us to the levels we wanted; hopeful that we'll continue to see some opportunities to finish out that ethane as well."
1,"Where such a product is protected by its patent portfolio from competitors copying, then a company like MiMedx is in the strongest position to build its assets by investing in market promotion and education for the long-term good of the marketplace, and clinical providers at the core to take care of those patients in need. We have spoken about our 5-Year Strategic Plan, delivering more than $560 million in revenues in 2020. With the allowance of these pending BLA programs in musculoskeletal pain, MiMedx revenues will actually reaccelerate in the two to three years following with a line of sight to $1 billion."
1,"Whereas the top line trend is stable, we saw appreciable reduction in losses in this period. This has been driven by the strategic initiatives taken over the last few years to strengthen these operations. The government's policy towards GM seeds and enforcing IPRs in this industry continues to be unclear and is hindering the enhancement of agricultural yield."
1,"While damage from the hurricanes will have a near-term impact on our results, we are encouraged by the health of our underlying business. We fully expect that our focused effort and investments in our key strategic initiatives will drive the long-term value for the La Quinta brand. As Jim mentioned, we are not providing guidance for 2018 in light of the expected timing of our planned spin-off and proposed acquisition of our franchise and management businesses by Wyndham."
1,"While Funding the Journey as a specific program will terminate by the end of 2018, the principles, standards and processes will remain a vital part of how we do business in Carlsberg in the future. Regarding SAIL'22, we invested in our strategic priorities in support of our core business and to change the growth profile of the group. During the year, we invested DKK 500 million into our core brands, capability building, further expansion of our craft and specialty brands, and alcohol-free brews and the establishment of activities in new territories."
1,"While integration still require dedication from our teams and incremental integration investment, we have a clear path forward to achieve our innovation and integration goals. In summary, we are proud of the results from our investment strategy, including both organic and M&A investments and the actions we have taken to strengthen our capital structure, our market positioning has strengthened significantly and we are encouraged by our integration progress. In total, due to the strong operating synergies, we expect a total purchase price valuation for the four acquisitions discussed of 10 times adjusted EBITDA in aggregate on a run rate basis as we exit 2018."
1,"While it's been a long path to the closing of these deals, we are excited about the value these two great banks add to our company. More importantly, we were pleased to be able to finally execute on our strategic plan. As we look at the financial results for the year, we reported record annual net income for our company of $153 million or $1."
1,"While the rate was impacted by lower wireless sales in Q1, we're also managing the business for accelerated growth and share gains. Aligned to our strategy of pivoting to the Intelligent Edge, we have been making significant R&D and go-to-market investments that have given us a leadership position in this high-growth market opportunity. Aruba Product grew 9% with strong growth in campus switching that continues to benefit from pull-through with the Aruba acquisition."
1,"While these are obviously aspects for the new strategic plan and as the Chairman said, everything will be clarified throughout this first half year, of course."
1,"While we are confident, our revenue volatility reduction initiatives will improve our operating performance overall, we do not expect to achieve the full benefits of this until later this year and early into next. Overall, we believe these three strategic priorities will help us achieve sustained and more predictable organic growth, improved operating margins with a long-term target, as previously mentioned of 35% EBITDA, and all this leading to a higher market cap and higher stock valuation. Drilling down further into our organic initiatives, we are focused on growing our direct business."
1,"While we continue to focus on driving more efficiency in the business, we're encouraged by a number of initiatives to generate revenue growth. For example, we're in the process of re-platforming our e-commerce site, a key component of our omni-channel strategy. The new site should improve our customer experience, increase product selection, and make it easier and faster to lease products at Aaron's."
1,"While we do not import any raw steel into North America, we have not been surprised to see the recent increases in domestic steel prices in response to potential tariffs on imported steel. As we move forward, we are confident our five strategic priorities will help us continue to create sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders. At the highest level, our global multi-channel business and the greater Herman Miller community remain focused on our mission to deliver inspiring designs to help people do great things."
1,"While we have many talented leaders at Molina, the rigorous demand of our turnaround require that we continue to assess our talent needs across the company and expand our leadership team. Mark Keim, our new Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning, Corporate Development and Transformation, will be the chief architect of our continued restructuring and will be the analysis of the business portfolio and work to unlock value in all of our major vendor and ancillary cost contracts. Mark's years of recent experience with me at Aetna, where he performed these similar activities, will surely create a significant amount of value."
1,"While we have not disclosed our 2018 priorities yet, rest assured that debt repayment from cash flow, along with our technology and fixed cost leverage priorities, will not be neglected. As a closing note, I want to thank the employees of Precision for their hard work and excellent results on all of our strategic priorities and especially the excellent progress made throughout the year on safety, and all the very good work our team has done on the implementation of Project 1, our new ERP system. So on that note, I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions."
1,"While we know we have important work ahead, the future of this company is bright, and I believe we have the strategy, assets and, most importantly, the people to deliver significant upside and value to our shareholders. We are well-positioned to deliver our strategic priorities in 2018. In June, I'll record my fifth anniversary at Chesapeake Energy."
1,"wholesale environment and we're also factoring in higher input costs to reflect the recent run-up in commodities as well as higher levels of marketing investment as we extend our innovation platforms to new product categories. That said, our diverse revenue base benefits from our acquisition strategy and savings from Project Booster position us to offset these headwinds and deliver another year of growth. At the midpoint, our guidance calls for mid-single digit revenue growth driven by a combination of organic growth and acquisition contributions and mid-single digit operating profit growth with a return to margin expansion in the second half."
1,"Why don't I share with you where we're focused on those investments, and then, Matt, why don't you add any color on sort of how that shows up from a financial standpoint? So, as we think about the allocation of that capital to key areas, right, you got to remember one of our key strategic initiatives is driving core growth, and so that would be the place that we would tend to prioritize that, as Matt said. And so, we think about driving that organic growth across three lens, how do we drive assets with new store sales or attracting new advisors; how do we grow assets in support of our existing advisors, we'll refer to those as same-store sales; and then finally, how do we improve or enhance the return on those overall assets."
1,"Why not in Austin, Texas or   no, I will not comment on that. I mean, we don't see our strategy as being a vacuum cleaner for craft breweries because that's the hype, no. We went into Lagunitas because we thought those were the guys who   first of all, it takes the opportunity to create the strategy."
1,"With a very strong Q4 rolling up into the solid year overall, 2017 was tremendously successful year for Everbridge, but also one where we established strategic and operational momentum for which we can continue to extend our success in the year ahead. Now, allow me to close by talking about a few of our operational and strategic initiatives. As I stated earlier, we continue to focus on our strategic initiatives to support long-term growth of our core Mass Notification business."
1,"With an improving book-to-bill and improving confidence of our suppliers and customers, we expect to continue this trend as we enter into the second half of fiscal 2018. Now, I'd like to provide you an update of the four pillars of Avnet's business strategy starting with our unique end-to-end ecosystem. Our ecosystem comprised of a small order specialist Premier Farnell; design-focused Hackster."
1,"With blue chip customers, we tend to have longer contracts, and with new customers we tend to have a shorter contract. But again, as you know, our strategy is to be able to maximize cash flow by cost control, by CapEx control, but also by the optimization of our pricing. We want to be able to take our fair share of the productivity gains brought by the new compression and the new modulation standards."
1,"With improved credit performance and loan yields, our realigned cost structure and a secure funding base, our lending business is well positioned to continue margin expansion and profit growth. We have also recently refined our long term strategic plan for OnDeck re-grounding our mission, vision and strategic focus for the company. Our mission is to create innovative lending experiences and financial products that help small businesses succeed."
1,"With improving cash flow, the company has the financial resources and flexibility to invest in organic growth initiatives and to judiciously pursue external growth initiatives when those opportunities arise and create long term shareholder value. So, in conclusion I'm confident that we have the right strategic initiatives in place, and the infrastructure and the talent to deliver sustainable growth over the mid to long term. And with that, I'll hand back to the operator and we're open for questions."
1,"With IPC, we executed the largest acquisition in Tennant's history. This significant achievement enabled us to further our strategy of diversifying our revenues by region, product category and sales channel. Our IPC integration remains on track, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve anticipated synergies over the next three years."
1,"With me on the call are Andrew Feinberg, Brightcove's acting Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Rhodes, Brightcove's Chief Financial Officer. During the call, we will make statements related to our business that may be considered forward-looking and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements concerning our financial guidance for the first fiscal quarter of 2018 and the full-year 2018, expected profitability and positive free cash flow, our position to execute on our go-to market and growth strategy, our ability to expand our leadership position, our ability to maintain and upsell existing customers and our ability to acquire new customers. Forward-looking statements may often be identified with words such as we expect, we anticipate, upcoming or similar indications of future expectations."
1,"With me this morning are Calin Rovinescu, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Benjamin Smith, President-Passenger Airlines; and Mike Rousseau, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, Calin will begin by highlighting our financial performance for the full year and quarter, and the progress made on our strategic initiatives. Ben and Mike will then address our fourth quarter financial performance and turn it back to Calin before taking questions from the analyst community."
1,"With me today are Sheryl Palmer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Cone, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Sheryl will begin the call with an overview of our business performance and our strategic priorities. Dave will take you through a financial review of our results, along with our guidance."
1,"With our strategy to keep our fleet tight relative to demand, we plan to further improve utilization this year assisted by the approach to our model year 2018 buy where we consciously contracted for fewer vehicles compared to model year 2017. We continue to see benefits from our strategic initiative to sell more of our risk fleets through alternative disposition channels. In the quarter, alternative channels accounted for 54% of our risk car sales compared to 42% in the prior year."
1,"With respect to the expense ratio, I think I even mentioned on the third quarter earnings call that on a go-forward basis, you probably need to bring that down to 27% instead of the 27. 5% on a go-forward basis and we're still doing the balance between strategic and non-strategic initiatives, but you know we ended both this year and last year around 27%. So, I would lower that by 0."
1,"With respect to the tax piece of it, obviously we were able to take the bottom-end of the guidance off the table, which we view that as a positive and slightly raised the top-end and that's the main driver. But we're also looking at really three parts to sort of the tax savings part of it is in the earnings, part of it we will look to continue to invest in our staff members in various ways, and part of it is we are able to evaluate and move forward to some of these strategic initiatives such as the ERP at corporate. So it's kind of a balanced approach and a little bit of each, if that makes sense."
1,"With strong medical teams and a focus on key specialties, we are well-placed to benefit from the structural demand supported by tailwinds from Ayushman Bharat as and when the same is rolled out. Our focus is to carry forward the momentum of recent quarters into the next 12 to 18 months and we are confident that our strategic initiatives will provide levers for high-quality growth and fortify our profitability. I now open the floor for questions."
1,"With that said, overall, the full year operating performance in 2017 was significantly below what we had expected to achieve as we entered the year. Despite the challenges we face, we were able to continue the momentum on key strategic initiatives, which I will speak to later, and generate $54 million of EBITDA from continuing operations after adjustment to include the non-cash impairment charge. At year-end 2017, our already healthy balance sheet is even stronger with a net cash position of $37 million and having repurchased $11 million of stock in the open market during the year."
1,"With the addition of David as our Government & Defense Business Unit President in January, our executive staff transition is complete. And we're ready to execute on our strategy and accomplish our task of exceeding our commitments with integrity, while we innovate The World's Sixth Sense to enhance perception, awareness in order to improve decision making to save lives and livelihoods. We intend to discuss our strategy in detail at our upcoming Investor Day on May 16 in New York City."
1,"With the Cajun-Sibon pipeline expected to be fully utilized during 2018, we are actively evaluating our next stage of solutions related to the Gulf Coast NGL infrastructure, and expect to have an update to share with you later this year. Our fifth growth strategy is to capture incremental gas opportunities with our franchise position in Louisiana. 2017 was a record-setting year for gas volumes in our gathering and transmission system with activity averaging around 2 Bcf per day."
1,"With the organization in place and commercial launch plans underway, we are well positioned for success in 2018. We secured $10 million in private equity financing that meaningfully fortifies our cash resources and allows us to effectively execute our health and nutrition growth strategy. This additional financing will accelerate our commercialization activities and demonstrates our commitment to maximizing value for the food companies, consumers, growers and our shareholders."
1,"With the strength of the market opportunities and our premier reputation with clients, Charles River is on a path to nearly double its size over the next five years. We are maintaining our long-term target for consolidated revenue growth at high-single-digits over the five-year life of our strategic plan, and low-double digits including acquisitions. Our long-term targets for the consolidated non-GAAP operating margin remains greater than 20%, even including acquisitions, because profitable revenue growth is key to our long-term goals."
1,"With these operational issues improving, our focus now is on winning back window volumes. Our major strategic initiatives in North America are on track such as the integration of MMI Door, preparing for the new volume with Lowe's and new product launches. In Europe, the demand environment is strengthening in most regions."
1,"With this as a backdrop, I'm turning to slide number 4, financial highlights. We generated a great fourth quarter, executing on our strategic initiatives. We achieved strong year-over-year growth in units on rent and continued to drive strong year-over-year rental rate performance."
1,"With this strong result, we ended the year with a backlog sales value 16% higher than a year ago setting the stage for growth in 2018. For almost 25 years, we have consistently paid dividends as part of our strategy to provide risk adjusted returns for our shareholders. Given our positive outlook and strong financial position, we were pleased to enhance our industry-leading dividend."
1,"Within our process, we always work with influencers. And actually, we are strengthening our effort to partner with influencers in the preparation of launches as well as of course in our communication strategy. Regarding the prestige cosmetic market, so in Luxury, we have two brands where we're playing in prestige cosmetics, so that's Gucci prestige cosmetics."
1,"Within our product team, we've recently appointed Rahul Advani as Vice President of Marketing. Rahul holds a PhD from MIT and brings almost 20 years at the marketing and strategic planning experience from Intel, Micron and Microsemi. He is a proven executive and will play a critical role in our efforts to broaden customer relationships and bring our innovative products to market."
1,"Without a doubt, our most significant achievement in 2017 was the progress we made on Project Centennial. Through this project, we have created a comprehensive strategic plan to drive shareholder returns by transforming Flowers Foods into a truly consumer-focused food company with a vision of being America's premier baker. During the year, we began executing on a number of new strategic goals to drive profitable growth and deliver shareholder value."
1,"Work also continues to harmonize brands within the division and establish clear sales channels for each brand in each geographic market. And lastly, Rotork Site Services remains key to our growth strategy. This business is embedded in each of our divisions, but predominantly in Controls and Fluid Systems."
1,"Would you consider regular share repurchases once you accumulate enough franking credit? And lastly, on Foxtel, can you elaborate on your media strategy in light of the merger and the subsequent planned IPO as the office has demonstrated that it had success with the media bundled strategy. Do you plan on moving deeper into content ownership or the other direction?"
1,"Wyman Roberts, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Joe Taylor, Chief Financial Officer, joined me this morning here in Dallas. During the comments portion of the call, Wyman and Joe will provide a more detailed overview of the second quarter and will update the progress of our strategic initiatives underway at the company. Of course, before we begin our comments, please let me remind everyone of our Safe Harbor regarding forward-looking statements."
1,"Yeah, I think, Aleksey, we would model it out as a plant per year to capture that   at least in the early years. We've got   our strategy teams are looking at different ways to configure that going forward, when do we move from Europe to Asia. So, there's still some work going on there, but I mean, I would frame it out in the long-term modeling as about a plant a year, our plants will probably get a little bit bigger, because we think we learned a lot from the first one, but a plant a year is a big way to think about that."
1,"Yeah, if I can just add. We talked about the tailwind in the first quarter, however, remember, we have a hedging strategy and that so whether it's a tailwind or a headwind, and we're really guiding towards more of a headwind, is because of our hedging strategy that we have employed. And so we're cycling some really good hedging gains from last year, which is causing most of that headwind for next year."
1,"Yeah, these numbers represent what we believe we can achieve over the three-year strategic planning horizon."
1,"Yeah, we're going to continue to execute against our strategy and the strategic priorities we got. Rick, that said, expectations near term of anything sizable, probably not."
1,"Yeah, we've said 17% to 18% is the target for this business, and we see a minimum of the underlying business before Royal of 17% as the target. And that's what we've laid out as our strategic plan going forward. So when I look at that business, it's got a number of years now at that 17% range and north of 17% is what we expect going forward."
1,"Yeah, with the capital raises in January, first of all, we felt it was a prudent thing to do. As you've seen, financial strength is across the Teekay Group and in fact is one of our strategic initiatives. This allows us to de-lever the parent balance sheet and increase our liquidity, which is over $500 million now."
1,"Yeah. And then, so as you look forward now, how does that play into your top two or three strategic priorities for the next year or two?"
1,"Yeah. And when it comes to that debt leverage, we expect that you're right that level that we're at today is a comfortable level, and any free cash flow might reduce the debt, but we'll also be using the cash for any acquisitions or investments, part of our strategy."
1,"Yeah. As I said, I don't see that there are any changes coming out of Canadian Tire's strategic plan, the impact, the REIT's strategies or growth agenda."
1,"Yeah. As Will Han mentioned, there was   we call out $263,000 of strategic initiatives related to infrastructure enhancements and severance payment. If you look at the run rate, though, you look at professional services coming up quarter-over-quarter about $1."
1,"Yeah. I think that's part of the long-term plan assuming that we're successful in our process and developing the   I mean, really integrating the platform probably a few years off to get there. We'd like to get ourselves the point where we're doing a $0."
1,"Yeah. Our strategy has outlined it   the first strategic point in our plan out of our three major points is, we want to maintain our growth level with our core mass notification product. We don't break it out, but we do tell you that the new products are growing faster because they're smaller."
1,"Yeah. So maybe where I'll start is, if you look at our four-square strategy where we segmented out across both our three underwritten brands, so Encompass Allstate and Esurance and Answer Financial which is more of an aggregator, and its risk that we earn fees on as opposed to underwriting. I think if I start in the top left on Encompass, I'd say there's kind of a nuance strategy there where we're still in the midst of implementing some pretty meaningful profit improvement actions both from a pricing, underwriting, risk selection perspective, but that there are states that we feel pretty good about that from a rate adequacy perspective and we'll look to grow, but in the grand scheme of things, we don't anticipate growth by Encompass in 2018."
1,"Yeah. So the reorganization, again, no comment on that yet, we're in the midst of sorting through exactly what that strategic plan is going to be which would then necessitate some of the changes that we want to make. But, reorganization that we talked about in Q3 that was unusual in nature and it was related to some of the actions that we took."
1,"Yeah. So, we haven't gotten to a point where we're willing to update sort of long-term plans around growth but there's a significant amount of interest from our franchisees to grow the business, both in existing and in new markets. When we refranchised in 2017, we signed a handful of development agreements, essentially in markets that had been sort of under penetrated, and our franchisees have strong commitments to build out those markets."
1,"Yeah. The long-term plan is still 50-50. Because remember, even as we bring this CAD 220 million of revenue in, we quickly look to increase that through also organic growth and selling the full end-to-end services at CGI."
1,"Yeah. The only thing I would add, Patrick, is that the two areas where the strategic planning process drove us to put emphasis on was in the semi side of Newport as well as the laser micro processing. So investments in capital, people, applications, and those are the two areas that drove a lot of the growth."
1,"Yes, absolutely, yes. We're seeing adoption states   thanks for asking that because that's important part of our strategy. We're seeing adoption states, as for these kinds of programs, their restrictions are being loosened up considerably, they're taking many more flexible kinds of materials in the state adoptions."
1,"Yes, as we looked   we've acquired two companies, one in 2014, we deleveraged; we acquired another one in 2016, we've deleveraged. So as we look at capital allocations, we're very disciplined on that, and we look at opportunities that will be accretive to our   both our growth strategy in terms of getting ultimately out of the state as well as our   the impact it will have on our EBITDA margins. We do not want to be a commodity based window company."
1,"Yes, hi, thanks for the opportunity. I have two questions, one is on your strategy. Now, does your overall strategy change as a result of Tencent/JD investment?"
1,"Yet, with just $14 of content per vehicle in North America and $7 in Europe, we have seemingly endless potential for additional content growth. Moving on to our Casting and Extrusion segment, our strategic initiatives are broadly aimed at; one, solidifying our leading positions through investments in technology and productivity; and two, growing through greenfield investments in Newmarket. Two years ago, in the face of increased price competition, we undertook a large capital program to radically transform the way we manufacture our large moulds."
1,You can see it in the store traffic. And we're going to continue our strategy as it relates to those. We're not cutting short the eCommerce investments.
1,"You can see on this slide, our exposure to at-risk tenants has been pretty minimal. And our strategy and proactive efforts that we've just spoken about from leasing and also from capital recycling, this exposure is not an accident. And it   when you compare it to our peers and to the mall REITs, again, if I do say so myself I think it is pretty, pretty impressive in this heightened retail bankruptcy environment."
1,"You can see the effectiveness of our growth strategy in the fourth quarter and annual results. Our objectives for 2018 will continue to be shaped by this strategy. As always, we aim to grow our market share by providing an unparalleled customer experience in stores and now online."
1,"You have a one-time new installation sales, but you usually don't get the service contract. So, in our growth strategy, we also have distributor models, but we clearly said we do not want to have more than 25% of our sales with a distributor model, which allows us to convert lion share of our newly installed elevators also or to convert them into our service business. So, this has been an improvement."
1,"You might just quantify that in terms of percent increase in corrugated prices. And second one is really just to try and get my head or get a better sense of your capital allocation strategy because, I suppose, in many ways that the special dividend is a great problem to have, in the sense of what you do with all of the cash. I suppose, there's a couple of elements is   how do you think now about capital allocation?"
1,"You really don't want to decrease capacity for those peak periods. With that said, there is a little bit of a strategic initiative going on where we're looking at our highest grossing theaters with our exhibition partners, looking at continuing to reseat those in a timely and prudent fashion. I think we'll still continue to do that."
1,"You shared a little bit more this time around on the used vehicle superstores. I was just wondering if you could elaborate maybe a little bit more on your strategy around that business. And then, as a related question, do you see opportunities to layer in sort of best practices from your franchise operations as it relates to parts and service over time?"
1,"You then take those two things combined and take the pieces that affect our wealth business and we feel we have the opportunity to create a third franchise in wealth, and then finally, everything we do across those three activities, we can do on a global basis. So overall, those seven items as we look at our objectives going forward and our ability to grow revenue and continue to build that sales pipeline, puts us in a position where we can factually say we've never been better positioned for future growth. Thanks for your interest."
1,"You were also indicating that you could revise CapEx on fiber depending on the regulatory. Related to the data growth, have you so far seen data growth in line with your strategic plan that you have announced at the end of 2016 or have you seen changes in data usage behavior of customers which could change your CapEx plans on fiber going forward? That's the first."
1,"You would recall in our last call that we were aspiring to get to a 20-20-20 performance by 2020, I'm pleased to share that we deliver to the above outcomes and if there are no regulatory headwinds, we are now aspiring to get to a 25-25-25 on sales, margins and EV growth. So, to sum up, Max Financial Services is delivering strong performance for shareholders via Max Life, which will further refine as Max Life delivers on the new strategic plan. We spoke about our vision of 20-20-20, which now improves to 25-25-25 and that's our aspiration."
1,"You'll see our new logo on our products, equipment, and public documents going forward. Looking further ahead, you can expect us to continue to execute our strategic plan to improve our world-class assets and to seize growth opportunities in areas where we can leverage our core competencies such as in wood products, in wood procurement and logistics, in green electricity, in wood-based chemicals and derivatives and of course in wood pulp and specialty paper products. That's the conclusion of our prepared remarks."
1,"You're on your way to $100 million in deposits per branch. I have to imagine that retention number gives you enormous confidence in being able to do these kinds of strategic initiatives. And do you think that beyond this, this next slate of branch closures, that we could see that $100 million become something higher?"
1,"You're seeing this coming together of payers and providers, which I think will continue to accelerate to have control over the dollars that are spent on healthcare and on the quality of the outcomes. As both private as well as public sector buyers push for value-based contracting and value-based outcomes, this kind of thing, I think does make sense; and again, we think it's validation of our strategy. We're relative ankle-biters compared to the size of these entities, but our clients really like this very personalized, highly tailored approach customized to their unique needs."
1,"YouTube seems to have a very strong dominance on the video platform space. What is your strategy like for 2018, because still on the online video, NAVER's position seems to be quite minor? So, I would appreciate if you could share with us the strategy?"
1,"You've heard this before from us is that our priority in capital deployment continues to be to support our organic growth strategies. That's been a core part of our strategy. That is the TD story on how we've been growing the bank and we will always use capital, whatever it takes to make sure we are managing that."
1,"You've seen the hard work by everybody on the integration front, also the capital structure. I'm looking forward to 2018 and also continuing to drive the key pillars of our strategy around growth, margin and cash in an improving environment. As we look at the industry, it's clearly got positive momentum and we've got an opportunity to capture that."
1,"Zyga is exactly a great example, I would say on the culture and the team that Jim Bullock had had assembled and the type of products we'd like to add for the differentiation and the growth that it provides. At the same time, like when we talk about our strategy on accelerating the spine business, there is a need for scale that would be driven mainly as a response to the consolidation happening in the healthcare market. We believe as we progress and make our strategy come to life, that we need to be in the top 10 providers in the markets that we are in, to ensure that we have the scope and the scale of the products to serve our customer needs."
0," ... strategic plan, right? Okay."
0," So Veg for Victory. Project Terra and onto our second pillar of our four-point strategic plan. Project Terra which is our cost saving plans and by the way anybody know what Terra means, from the earth up."

0," 07) I keep there. Q&A around the guidance, around the prospects, around the long-term plan."
0, 1 million of cash on the balance sheet. The wind down of this former operating business over the past six months represents a significant resolution to the volatility in our income statement and underperforming assets in our strategic plan. Our GAAP leverage stands at 1.
0," 1 million, higher than the $18. 2 million in 2016, mostly due to increased head count and systems in support of strategic initiatives in IT and talent management. At the end of the year, our balance sheet remained strong with significant flexibility to support future growth."
0," 14 less. With that, I'd like to open the call for your insightful questions and looking forward for your great feedback on our strategy."
0, 2 billion and the net proceeds are approximately $800 million. We will be evaluating the use of the proceeds as well as the benefits from tax reform as part of our overall capital allocation strategy. We remain very committed to the balanced capital allocation process that we have followed for many years.
0," 23) trader, very quick three questions; at presence the biggest assets of Rostelecom 45% in Tele2, 15% of the fixed-line operation, unfortunately your strategy didn't mention anything about the way you will be growing your capitalization. Do you have any plans to grow your market cap, if so, what are they and what are the departments in the company which will be responsible for that?"
0," 25) to confirm Icade's strategy with the ambition of Icade SantÃ© to Europeanize. And so, what are the issues on your table in terms of your new strategic plan? Are you wanting to update the objectives rather than the strategy?"
0," 26 of earnings in the prior year. When adjusting for the strategic initiative expenses, inventory step-up, restructuring expenses, automotive segment consolidation expenses and one-time favorable tax benefit, adjusted earnings per share of $0. 67 was up $0."
0," 34) and you also spent some time in the automotive supply base at IAC and at Lear if I understand, and we also have Craig Barber who is the Director of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning."
0, 36). So I recognize that your strategy under Marlin 2. 0 and 3.
0," 38), can you talk a bit about how the deal was sourced and if you've changed your strategy for the larger deals at all?"
0," 4% of our revenues, so we have a bit of everything. Our objectives are made at the average 2017 rate. We..."
0," 41 per share in Q1. In summary, 2017 was a year where we delivered on our commitments and saw our strategy translate into Marketplace acceleration of GMV and revenue growth. U."
0," 42) mine, we started that and really is part of the history of Buenaventura. In the case of Mallay, we have a short-term plan trying to take advantage of the location, but in the long-term plan, probably, we have to discuss a different way to deal with these smaller assets. And in the case of La Zanja, we are working together with Newmont to increase our exploration programs in order to create long-term business case based on copper deposits."
0," 43) summary. In 2017, we consistently executed our strategy. We pursued our growth path."
0," 45) with your telco strategy plus the SAP system ride quite easily, putting that on top of the existing platform? Thanks."
0, 46) and a loan-to-value ratio of around 45%. This is all within the bandwidth of our objectives. And we also benefited from the good environment prevailing in the capital markets with the issuance of the CHF 250 million straight bond for nine years at a coupon of 0.
0, 5% a year ago. We are well positioned financially to continue to advance   advancing our growth strategy. I'd like to turn the call back to Milton for closing remarks.
0, 53) we should see the most impact from the strategic priorities? Thank you.
0," 53), I don't have that number right now and that is something which we are working with respect to our long-term strategy. However, it will be suffice to tell you that our goal is to maintain the similar rate of sales growth which is this CAGR that I shared with you."
0," 55) some airports, the formal masses sites that have been sort of converted into large-format retailers. Could you sort of walk us through what your strategy is from this point looking forward? Are you looking at any of those key spots or just give us a little bit of flavor around it?"
0, 59) specialist installer at the end. How are you sort of evolving your own strategy to cope with e-commerce or even use it as a way of gaining market share?
0, 6 million for 2016. This concludes my financial review and I will now turn the call over to Jim for the progress update of our business strategy.
0," 7 billion in 2018, 45% of that $1. 7 billion will be on strategic initiatives. That's almost triple of what we spent in 2017."
0," 7 million in 2016. To summarize, we are well on-track to meet our objectives and we're now moving on to the conclusion of this presentation on slide 39. I would like to finish off this presentation by saying that in 2017 we have taken further steps in the execution of the plan laid out at the IPO."
0," A few words on the corporate segment. The earnings reported there reflect effects of our currency diversification strategy. Our overall equity, as measured in U."
0," A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and our explanation of why the non-GAAP financial measures may be useful are discussed in today's earnings release. With me today are Doug Ewert, CEO, who'll provide his perspective on fiscal 2017 and our fourth quarter results and review our strategic initiatives; and Jack Calandra, CFO, who will provide a more in-depth review of our financial results and outlook. I would now like to turn the call over to Doug."
0," Again, I put that into the upside category. We don't need that to happen to hear growth our objectives. If it happens, it will be a bonus though."
0," All right. And if you can't articulate where you fit in the world and what your strategy is, half of the trick of capital allocation and investment allocation is knowing what you're not going to do as it is knowing what you're going to do."
0," Also the board when we decided on this dividend, well, we took into account that we have initial year of the capital ratio reduction with the integration of BMN, and so we wanted to have an approach that was cautious. I think this payout, we'll talk about the   when we talk about the strategic plan, but as the integration process of BMN stabilizes, then we'll go back to levels that we believe are sustainable in the mid-term. Are those levels higher than 42%?"
0," Also two questions from my side, please. And the first one is just to go back to your UK proposition in light of upcoming ring-fencing access and deposit base within the ring-fence and your strategy on mortgages. I just wondered if you could shed a little bit of light on the launch of the new intermediary mortgage platform, which I think has successfully launched in 4Q."
0," An update on Major Developments and particularly how that ties into a large sites piece, our customer proposition and where we see ourselves in the market. Some of the things we've touched on already around resourcing, direct labor, actually how we get our build strategy right over a longer period of time and pieces on social purpose in that community and political risk. And lastly of all and I touched on it already, but also just making sure we're clear on our dividend policy."
0," And could you possibly also tell us what would impact them in terms of how you would tackle it? I think it was quite interesting, on your release you stated that the strategy and the business will encompass the same standpoints, whether it's a majority holding irrespective of their legal or organizational makeup. On that point, can you also remind us, let's say for Powertrain, how you would be able to actually bring this to the stock exchange if possible?"
0, And how much are you going to invest in prices? And what are your objectives there?
0," And I just wondered given the increasing complexity of these new drugs, do you expect to see any potential delays in terms of new drug development from that side of the business in Ashfield? And then, separately, we've seen a number of strategic initiatives of your peers, as they seek to offer a more integrated approach and return to growth and they know that's not going to impact you in the near term, but I just wondered if you're seeing any impact on business activity in Ashfield from competitive sources. Thanks."
0," And just on the plan to sell down Otway, you've targeted 30%, just wondering why that number   why you feel that's the right number there, and I guess in terms of what you've talked about today in terms of pushing back timing for drilling etc etera and to take more time to understand what to do with the asset. Do you plan to have all of that sorted out by the time you enter into some sort of sale process there just to give the potential buyer some clarity as to what your long-term plans are there?"
0," And secondly is that you have acquired the   you have an agreement to acquire five kindergartens, can you give some color on the acquisitions like the kindergarten, the current operating status and the variation range? And more importantly, can you provide more your view on your M&A strategy along the   in the future? Thank you."
0," And so there was an effect in H2, but it's not really that significant and certainly not significant. This won't change our strategy to address the margin issue."
0," And so, people are thinking, they are planning. But there, it's hard to make long-term plans in the current climate. So, I'd say everyone's just holding onto the rollercoaster."
0," And some of that coming off a difficult fourth quarter and as I alluded to in my prepared remarks, we're experiencing the similar softness that we experienced the last couple of periods of 2017 into our first couple of periods of 2018 here. So, we know it's going to take a little bit of time but I'm very excited about the work because you've got to make sure that you're leveraging the research and the data and appropriately applying the strategic initiatives that we have in place. So, very confident not only around the back half of 2018 but most confident and excited about 2019 and beyond because of all the investments we put in place this year."
0," And the last question is on your competitor, Spectrum Brands, that has announced that it wants to diverge its small domestic appliance business. Is it something that you are looking at or is it too big, maybe doesn't fit with your strategy in the U. S.?"
0," And the second on Unity, and the pipeline, and visibility and the activity there. If it's   are you confident about the release and your objectives in 2020?"
0," And the second thing I would say is that if you look at our new customers that came in, in 2017, we do see in   I mean, in the areas where we had these deals that there is a predominant demand for fiber. And hence, that's why we are so convinced about the validity of this long-term plan to push fiber."
0," And then also could you just maybe expand a little bit on what's going on with Speedcast, what that   what you are serving there, I guess my understanding was a lot of that capacity is already full on the consumer side. So just wondering what the long-term plan is with that win and what you're going to be doing there? Thanks."
0," And then just a follow-up for Rick. We heard from another big peer of yours earlier this week that tax reform is has set enough of a clear playbook where they are actually able to reduce some of their legal identity count and some of the complexity and basically the resources that drive your tax strategy, I mean, clearly Eaton has a pretty robust tax strategy. Some of that gets simplified and maybe what were you know some of the corporate costs associated with it?"
0," And then lastly, PSCs, a big unmet medical need that could be even bigger than PBC considering lack of benefit by Urso. Can you update us on your status there, and the data that you've generated and how you think that would be received by FDA and how you might adjust your strategy going forward?"
0," And then second on the Consumer side, broadband losses continue. What are your thoughts on the consumer broadband strategy going forward? Thank you."
0," And we believe that'll give us greater value in the future as well. So, a number of things at play here, but all very positive as we move forward with our ONETractor strategy."
0," And we'll have more in the months ahead to say about some of these initiatives globally. So with that great recap of 2017, you've got a perspective now on the success we've had in 2018, our key strategic priorities and also I think a more in-depth look into the company and the culture that we're building with the vision that we will become one of the world's leading global biotechnology companies focused on rare metabolic disorders. With that, operator, we're happy to take any questions."
0," And what was the right thing to do? The right thing to do was to accelerate some of the investments that were already in our strategic plan, and one of those was the investments that we're making in our partners. And I think that was absolutely the right thing to do for our partners and for our company, and I'll separate that from any personal point of view I might have as a citizen."
0," And while I acknowledged in our last call that this is a long road we're on, we've been passing the mile markers at a steady pace. Yet our stock has tumbled lately for reasons that I can't explain, obviously we've been caught up in broader trends, but from where I sit, I believe we've continually advanced our strategy and delivered outstanding performance from our Commercial Real Estate portfolio. I apologize for the sirens in the background; they're not coming to our building."
0," And, Brad, congratulations again on your appointment. I really appreciate you kind of running through the vision and strategic priorities. Could you maybe just, given it's your first time on the call, so step back and maybe say what attracted to you to the Whiting opportunity?"
0, Are you willing to wait to invest more in tissue depending on the results of this new mill? What are your more long-term plans or medium-term plans? The second question would be on the political noise.
0," As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Joseph Elgindy, Director of Investor Relations & Strategic Initiatives for Kulicke & Soffa. Joseph, you may begin."
0," As those four initiatives are instrumental to deliver on our financial ambition, Carsten will provide more visibility on their potential. Ladies and gentlemen, looking at the strong results in 2017, we had a good start into our strategic cycle and made substantial progress in the implementation of our strategic priorities. With this, let me hand over to Carsten."
0," As you've doubled the package size in the Permian, I think, two to five as you said, do you think at some point you have to get to a cubed style development, for lack of a better term? And the benefits and costs of doing that, do you think that's necessary or can you more moderately increase the package sizes over time and accomplish your objectives?"
0, Asia has been an interesting market for eBay really from the beginning particularly some of the things that you're doing in Korea now with first party sales. How is your strategy in those market is different from what investors are used to in the U. S.?
0," Banks. I'll now turn the call over to Bruce Lee, Heartland's President, who will provide an overview on the company's strategic initiatives. Bruce?"
0," Before I turn the call over to Dave, I'd like to congratulate him on his recent promotion to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Operating Officer. In his new role, Dave assumes the responsibility for strategic planning and business development while continuing his leadership role within finance, real estate, and distribution. I will now turn the call over to Dave."
0," Bob is our Senior Vice President of Operations in charge of the train plans, Casey Albright's group, as well as dispatching, locomotive fleet working very closely with Brian. And then Amy Rice, our Vice President of Strategic Planning who is a genius. Setting over here to the left who did the safety presentation is Brian Barr, part time comedian, part time mechanical officer, but he takes care of our locomotive fleet."
0," Brian Delaney, Corporate CFO; Mr. Chaiyapat Paitoon, Deputy Corporate CFO and Strategic Planning; and Mrs. Jutatip Adulbhan, Vice President of Investor Relations, who will join Mr."
0," But I think the key issue there, David, is no change in our capital allocation strategy."
0," But in hard luggage, I think Safari has become pretty aggressive when you look at the new range that they've launched in 2017, 2018. So what's your strategy to tackle this increased competitive intensity?"
0," But that's healthy compared to the unhealthy 2016. And with that, we're very happy in executing our strategy. That's a good backdrop."
0," But under any outcome, tax reform is good for utility customers and good for shareholders. Now I'd like to turn over to Jerry Norcia who'll go with the long-term plan for producing these earnings and dividend growth."
0," But you've got investment in that vertical stack of assets. And so, when somebody basically kicks the basement window out, they tell you that you can't have any water to grow the crop, it's not exactly   in all respect of these big companies, it's not the easiest thing to go to, to think through your vertically integrated strategy and figure out which pieces, at the least cost in profitability, can come out of your vertical stack to allow you to continue to be a profitable company. So, I'm not going to mention names, because that would just get me in Dutch with some people, but it's clear that some of the companies are doing better than others at managing this issue."
0," By the sound of it, it's completed. Can you just talk about some of the implementation timing around that strategic plan and is there any cost associated with that? And maybe a little bit more color."
0," Can you expand a little bit more on your potential external growth strategy in terms of where you might find the most relevant assets either regionally or by subsector. Can you expand on that a little, size by size?"

0," Could I ask for an update on how your holiday villa is and how things in Italy are because I recall you said the only thing you wanted to buy in Italy was your holiday villa, then it changed, but in current circumstances, where are we? And then a final question, how is DÃ¼sseldorf trading and how is your strategy for focusing Eurowings there and competition, and how profitable can DÃ¼sseldorf be as a part of your business?"

0," First of all, we are working with a lot of scenarios. There is not the one long-term strategic planning. And this time you need to have a base, but you need to work with different scenarios, what will happen and what do you do in the company when this or this happens."
0," First, we'll have Pepe and then Leo with the presentation. I would also like to tell you that on the 27th of February, we'll be presenting our new strategic plan. We will send you the invite to participate."
0," for 21st Century. Can you talk about the strategy behind the launch and how your direct-to-consumer strategy is going to evolve over the next few years, particularly with this greater focus on sports and news? Do you expect to have a direct-to-consumer service featuring your brands and content?"
0," For fiscal 2018, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million. This spend is driven by technology investments and new or remodeled stores to support our strategic initiatives. Lastly, we opened 10 stores in 2017, 8 Madewell, 1 J."
0," Given the current timeline for M&A activity in the agribusiness sector, we would continue to expect to begin to realize the potential of some of those enterprise agreements in FY 2019. That said, a secondary benefit from our new solution strategy is it does reduce our dependency on the timing of crop when science company is converting to enterprise agreements. As discussed earlier, we're making a business model change to our ClearPath Weather product line."

0," Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. Maybe for you, Ashok, as you shift your strategy towards technology- and analytics-driven platform business, what percentage of your business right now would you consider platform and maybe what do you anticipate that reaching in the future? And then what is the margin profile of this business relative to the rest of the business that you have?"
0," Got it. And Mick, one question for you in terms of Brightree, can you give us the broad contours of your international strategy? Congrats on a nice quarter."
0," Hey, thanks for the question. On fedratinib, could you expound on what your filing strategy is? Would you be filing for a broad label or for treatment experience label?"
0," Hi, guys. In the past conference call, you mentioned you guys weren't looking at current strategic initiatives, is that still the case?"
0," I believe firmly that having products that are not connected is a recipe for disaster in the future. I think everything that we manufacture and sell will need to be a connected product within a very short order, which is why this is one of our objectives."
0," I have a general question. So we see that your strategy in FinTech is quite successful, there are   something like 430 FinTech's in the Netherlands, we have a good base to choose from. The question is more big tech."
0," I have equal confidence in the line of business presidents, who have proven their ability to effectively lead organizations, and who will retain broad responsibility for their operations as they report to Ned. In addition to strengthening our day to day operations, this move will give me more time to focus on developing strategic initiatives and seeking opportunities for future growth. Frank?"
0, I have three questions if I may. The first one is about your strategy for AWT in the next couple of years. You are going to spend some CapEx to integrate your business downstream.
0," I hope you all have the presentation material available. Today, we will start with the Group's CFO, JÃ¸rgen Rostrup, taking us through the financial results; followed by Group CEO, Sigve Brekke, presenting   giving us updates on the strategic priorities and our progress on digital transformation. There will, as usual, be a Q&A session after the presentation."
0," I look forward to reporting continued progress throughout the coming year. Before we open the call for questions, I would like to thank our customers and suppliers for their partnership, our shareholders for their ongoing support, and most importantly, our associates for their daily efforts to execute our strategic plan. Over one-third of our 15,000 associates have worked for the company for over 10 years, which speaks to our relationships and the high degree to which value their contributions."
0," I mean, this second question and this is particularly relating to Popular segment, which is 36% of your revenues currently. One is what really is your strategy there? I mean, I understand that you franchised out certain part of the business, but even from the existing business, it seems that you're losing competitiveness out there."
0," I think that's an area that we're really just starting to see huge interest by the OEM customers in applying our technologies in microclimates that will become extremely important as cars move to, especially, electrification. So, I think there's a lot of opportunities, and you'll start to hear more and more about those as we refine our strategy."
0," I want to save Valentine's Day for other people, but regarding where you are in the stage of your operating margin expansion, can you detail some of the efforts ahead and are you in inning one or two or three of that margin expansion program? And then secondly, regarding I know CrossLab has been part of your strategy to take share. What's your visibility?"
0," I'd like to start by sharing some headlines on progress made over the past year. Kirk will then talk you through the financials, and then I'll step through our strategic plan and update on progress against each part. And like I said, no doubt we have some questions at the end."
0," I'd like to update you on our integration progress. After that, I'll give you an overview of our strategic initiatives to capture market opportunities and thoughts on 2018. I'll then turn the call over to Daryl who will discuss fourth quarter and full year results in detail as well as our 2018 financial outlook."
0," If large project coming up, of course, we support our customers, but we will not go broaden the market with power. That is not our strategy. But, obviously, for big projects we make exceptions and take the revenue, yeah."
0," If you look at the biggest glass company in India, it's way, way, way smaller than what you'd find in Europe given the population size of India, for example. So we're very clear on what   our strategy remains the same as before. U."
0," If you now turn to page 8, titled Key Benefits of Separation For Spirit Post Spin, we believe the impact to Spirit is quite significant. Not only are the portfolios better aligned to our Heat Map and investment strategy, the quality of our cash flow will improve by nature of dividing out some of the concentration in that secured debt we currently are faced with, and we significantly reduced the overall and secured leverage to position the company for growth. We'll have over $1 billion of liquidity for future capital allocation decisions."
0, I'll spend some time going over the details of the financial results. And then Dennis will further discuss the acquisitions and our strategy going forward. Before we begin I'll need to remind everybody that our comments may include forward looking statements.
0," I'll take the first two on Acthar and then, again, I'll turn it back to Steve to talk about the VTS-270 trial opportunities. With regards to our objectives in our Acthar payer strategy, obviously what we're trying to do long term is ensure appropriate access for the product for patients that are refractory, in most cases, and have relatively few options. And so, our overall strategy is just as you describe."
0," I'm going to turn it over to Susan. She is going to talk about two of our key strategic initiatives that's repositioning and differentiating our brand for the use of better ingredients and our guest experience work. So, let me turn it to Susan now."
0," I'm pleased to introduce MiMedx today. From the company we have Pete Petit Chairman and CEO; Chris Cashman Chief Commercialization Officer; and Mark Landy, Senior Vice President of Strategic Initiatives."
0," I'm Steve Smith and lead our Data Center Engineering. What I'd like to do is take you through our objectives for this briefing, a little bit of material, and then we will allow plenty of time for Q&A. So, you should have the slides available to you via the website."
0," In total, combined cash CapEx and inventory purchases for 2018 are expected to be approximately $20 million lower than our previous guidance. On balance, 2017 was a solid year, as we delivered on our objectives and ended on a very strong quarter. We believe 2018 will be an important transition year as we continue to increase bandwidth, revenues and adjusted EBITDA."
0, It doesn't change our capital allocation strategy at this time. Not at all.
0, It just had slow entitlements. It doesn't really impact our long-term plan and doesn't impact any of our California long-term assets at all.
0," It's   we're really happy with it. Look, our objectives here are very simple which is the transaction online through PayPal was full of friction before because PayPal was steering away from us, because it was hard to do dispute resolution. It's worked out very well for both of us."
0, It's not the driving force. It's not changing our strategy at all on M&A.
0," It's year by year. Of course, the strategic plan and the financial plan, it's longer than a year, but the actual target is based on a yearly basis."
0," Just following up a little bit more here on National Pen, you obviously talked about the increased marketing activities, changes to the marketing campaigns et cetera. I was just wondering how far along you are in improving or building out National Pen's e-commerce capabilities, I believe that was one of your objectives post-acquisition is just improve their e-commerce capabilities?"
0," Just with regards to Industrial Automation, maybe just your expectations specifically for that segment for growth for 2018. 5% was pretty solid for 2017, but obviously this is the kind of the area where, I think, you'd expect to see some of the benefits flow-through from the strategic initiatives, new products launches, et cetera. So how much of that kind of comes through in 2018?"
0," key markets for us are Canada, UK, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, UAE, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand. In this business, this strong visibility of growth with healthy margins and will leverage our existing brand legacy to achieve our objectives. We continue to invest in expanding the distribution network in the U."
0," Leading today's call is Mr. William Huang, GDS' Founder, Chairman and CEO, who will provide an overview of our business strategy and performance. Mr."
0," Looking at the next page if I can get to it, there we go. Looking at our strategic priorities for 2017. 2017 was a good year, but it's not just about the fact that the year was pretty good."
0," Maybe just lastly, comment a bit on your acquisition strategy."
0," NewCo is expected to be unlevered and generate significant free cash flow with a strategic focus on developing its growth oriented assets and returning capital to shareholders. Now the past year has been very successful and the strategic plan we've executed on has resulted in significant shareholder value. Our outstanding performance could not have been achieved without our talented workforce, supportive board and our many business partners."
0," Next question is, when will you uplist to the Nasdaq? Well, our long-term plan is to uplist to the Nasdaq Exchange at the right time and when we meet the requirements of the Nasdaq listing. Certainly one of our goals is to get up there."
0," Next to that, I'd like to mention two other indicators of our financial position, and that's the net cash position of â‚¬27 million and a corporate equity of â‚¬2. 7 billion, which reflects the value of our adjusted strategic plan. Then over to the last slide of this part of my presentation, dividend."
0," Next up, Steve Barnhart, our brand new CFO. Steve, with all of your long-term experience with FTD, do you have the cash flow, personally, does FTD have the cash flow to fund this   the strategic plan internally or will you borrow to fund the plan?"
0," Now I'll turn the call over to Mark, who will review Berry's financial results in more detail. Then I'll come back and summarize our strategy and open the call for questions. Mark?"
0," Now on to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q."
0," Now, as you know, they have developed some of our most successful games ever and they've proven time and again that they know how to keep our players engaged for the long haul. So overall I'd say our strategy for Call of Duty is working. WWII is a blockbuster."
0," Okay, okay, good. And I know that's one of your new strategic planning legs as well. We don't have time to get into it, but I understand what you're saying."
0," Okay. And similar to PhotonBlade, so you're initially that   your two kind of initial surgical areas are both gyne and the breast and plastic surgeons, or kind of what's your strategy for selling into   you mentioned colorectal for instance or maybe some other potential surgical areas?"
0," Okay. And then in terms of your legal strategy out of the gate here in the court system, is there anything that you can tell us in this early stage that might make your strategy differ from some of your peers or differ from that engaged by PG&E in the Butte Fire last year? I realize it's, obviously, still early there and you're probably limited in what you can say, but I'm curious to hear your thoughts."
0," Okay. And then, what is SIR's long-term plans with the ILPT shares?"
0, Oliu. Do you consider M&A in the new Strategic Plan?
0," Olivier will then provide more detail on the financials and discuss our first quarter and full-year 2018 outlook. Anders will conclude with progress made on Zebra's strategic priorities. Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Senior Vice President of Global Sales, will join us as we take your questions."
0," On my right, your left, the first person in the row, Urs Schaeppi, our CEO. Urs, as you can see, from the slide number 2 in your presentation will start presenting with the highlights of 2017, before discussing our proven strategy, being best-in-class. Thereafter, he's giving an update on our Swiss infrastructure, presenting the performances and ambitions of our retail and B2B unit, before addressing our new cost targets 2018 to 2020, to capture maximum benefits."
0," On the call with us this morning are Mark Duff, CEO; Dr. Lou Centofanti, Executive Vice President of Strategic Initiatives; and Ben Naccarato, Chief Financial Officer. The company issued a press release this morning containing fourth quarter and 2017 year-end financial results, which is also posted on the on the company's website."
0," On the pricing question specifically, it's a little early to talk about pricing for us. What I can tell you is, we'll take a very thoughtful and reasonable approach to our pricing strategy, and we'll be more forthcoming as we get closer to launch. We have not engaged payers yet on that   the pricing conversation because when we engage them we want to have the Phase 3 data in hand, which we do now, and we'll continue those conversations with the payers."
0, One last question. Now in your IP there is a slide on near-term strategic priorities. So in this I fail to see anything around capital allocation.
0," People come to us to see what's happening and to understand what's going on in the world based on their interest, and live video helps us be one of the fastest places to see what's happening, but more importantly generates a conversation and shows the commentary associated with it. One of the things that is really important to us is continuing to broaden our live strategy more towards events, as I talked about previously on the call, so that whatever event is happening, whatever topic and interest that you're interested in, you can quickly get to the conversation and the commentary. In some cases, we will have an associated live stream or multiple live streams associated with that topic or that interest or that event, but no matter what, you always see the conversation and you always see the top commentary from experts within whatever field that it has to do with."
0," Phase two, strategic priorities and outlook. Thanks, Ros."
0," Phil Rohrbaugh announced that he plans to retire in March of 2018, concluding an over five-year tenure at Fulton. Phil has been a key member of our executive leadership team, and was very instrumental in leading the transformation of our risk management area, improving operational efficiencies, and driving the company's strategic plan. On behalf of the board of directors, I want to thank him for his contributions, and wish him the best in retirement."
0," Robert Drake, Group CFO; Mr. Roland To, Senior Director of Strategic Planning; and Mr. Peter Caveny, Assistant Senior Vice President of Investor Relations."
0," S. , maybe you could remind us of that and then talk about your strategy outside of the U. S."
0," S. food testing market, the largest in the world, and a critical market for our AFL strategy. At the end of 2017, the SGS Group had over 95,000 employees and 2,400 locations around the globe."
0," S. goes, clearly we will   we're still working out our launch strategy, so we can't give too much visibility, other than the fact that we are anticipating a launch in Q1 of FY 2020. And I think, over and above that, we continue to have discussions even for the U."
0," S. if you could just talk about your objectives there, what should we be expecting to see in Nielsen? What's the picture of success?"
0," Second question on QIAGEN, how much is the expected contribution from the partnership in 2018 and 2019? And the last question on your strategic plan, compared to your target on 2019, which is growing better than what was compared to your original expectations? Thank you."
0," Since joining as CEO last June, I've personally conducted hands-on reviews of all areas of the business including each functional group and have traveled to all company locations multiple times, as have the members of the new management team. We know which assets are foundational to our long-term plans and which assets are non-strategic that we may choose to monetize. We have assessed market opportunities that pass my real, worth it and winnable tests."
0, So here's the agenda for today. And you'll hear from me first with an overview of our progress against the strategy we laid out a year ago. Brian will then take you through the financial results for the fourth quarter and also update you on the strategy looking out to 2021 and beyond.
0," So now that one of your peers is making that significant acquisition, your balance sheet has its lowest leverage profile of the group. How do you view your overall capitalization within context of your capital deployment strategy?"
0," So one of the things you didn't spend a lot of time talking about today was FirstNet. Just curious if you can comment on the ramp of FirstNet and just where that fits within your strategic initiatives that you laid out? And then the second piece of the question is, so you talked about this year $20 million to $40 million of revenue."
0," So thank you very much for being here with us. We are now going to start with the presentation of the Strategic Plan. JosÃ© Ignacio, Pepe and Leo will be presenting it to us."
0," So that was an update of our Q4 results and our guidance for the first quarter. Now, I'd like to ask Paul to share with you our business strategy and outlook."
0, So these are totally in line with our strategic priorities. These are more top priorities specifically for 2018.
0," So we've got broken out some responsibilities. And with Brent's elevation to Chief Operating Officer, he will kind of drive a lot of the strategic initiatives from an operational standpoint across the company. Of course, Ben Clouse has been in Brent's finance area with the new CFO."
0," So, after the IPO, eventually it may go down. It may go down all the way to 0%, but that's part of your strategy?"
0," So, CapEx, between $40 million and $47 million. Free cash, between $25 million and $33 million, which is in line with the strategic plan. So, there is the guidance."
0," So, first of all, yes, we do own the worldwide rights to ifetroban and all its potential uses. Our strategy has been to focus on the U. S."
0," So, I don't think you're seeing a swap of material market share. I think what you're seeing is us continue to grow consistent with our objectives. We are underpenetrated in many markets around the globe."
0," So, I would say, in the year 2017, we got even more visibility as far as where retailers are within this journey and gave us more conviction that it's actually a multi-year journey, not just a short term. And so, through that process then, as you go into your strategic planning and you go through with your annual planning, those conversations tend to happen more when you're doing your operating planning and strategic planning meetings with the board. Those are more back-half loaded versus front-half loaded."
0," So, if we think we can divest something to drive shareholder value, we'll do it. But we have no need to do it in the short, medium or long term to be able to achieve our objectives, okay?"
0," So, it's good to be position with our four companies there, and we do see more construction activity and our customers were calling and saying, look, which companies, which projects are you committed on? But we're going to take the best projects that fit our metrics and our objectives."
0," So, let's take a look at today's agenda. Jonathan Bush, our Chief Executive Officer, will begin with a few opening remarks about our purpose as an organization, our plans to operate and deliver on our commitments, and our strategy to reach our fullest potential in the years to come. Marc Levine, our Chief Financial Officer, will then discuss our current financial profile, the strength of our recurring revenue business model, and our financial operating principles."
0," So, that's add-ons to the questions already been asked. And then maybe on slide 25 on the strategic priorities on UK farming, you're saying Brexit has the potential to lead to fundamental change in UK agriculture, and I have in front of me things like input cost inflation, farm support systems post cap, and import, export tariffs. Are these concerns that you are seeing impacting the farmers now under investment decisions, or is this still too far in the future for them but you are seeing this as something that has to be addressed from your side of the business now, so you're well positioned going forward?"
0," So, yes. I think you'll see this become a bigger and bigger part of our strategy and a bigger part of the results that we're seeing."
0," So, you've mentioned GBSD clearly as very important pursuit. What's your strategy to win and how do you feel OA will help you if you think they will?"
0," Thank you for joining Bureau Veritas for Year 2017 Results. Nicolas Tissot, our CFO, and Philippe Donche-Gay, Senior Executive Vice President in charge of driving the implementation of the group's strategic plan, are here with me to present our full-year results. 2017 was a solid year for the group."
0," Thank you for the opportunity. My question on the   first on the   the opportunity in the stressed real estate sector, how we are approaching that segment and secondly, what is our long-term business strategy in that segment?"
0," Thank you very much, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call. Presenting today are Bernard CharlÃ¨s, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Thibault de Tersant, Senior EVP and General Secretary; and Pascal Daloz, our new CFO and Corporate Strategy Officer. Some brief reminders."
0," Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. The team is joining this morning from Bogota following the announcement of Frontera's exceptional 2017 financial and operational results, the successful operational results so far in 2018 and the exciting news of new additions to the senior executive team that will execute the long-term plan and vision of Frontera. Today, I'm joined by Barry Larson, our CEO; Alejandro PiÃ±eros, our Acting CFO, Camilo Valencia, our VP of Operations; Erik Lyngberg, our VP of Exploration; and Duncan Nightingale, our VP of Development."
0," Thank you, Olaf. Following the deep dive into our financials, I would now like to take you through our strategic priorities and initiatives. Chart 21 please."
0," Thank you, Rafael. There are several questions about when we will receive the new strategic plan. But Mr."
0," Thank you. And then, can you elaborate on the decision to sell the data services piece of Rigzone, but retaining the career services piece and why that makes sense with your tech-focused strategy?"
0," Thanks for that. And then one more, just on the long-term plan, the EPS update. Just to be clear."
0, Thanks very much. We will look forward to your strategy update then. Thank you.
0," Thanks, good afternoon. Could you update us on your strategy to expand Visa Europe into some of the higher growth markets where you're less well represented, for example, Nordics, Italy, and Germany?"
0," Thanks, Keith. Now, I'd like to summarize our strategy. So, please refer to slide 18."
0," Thanks. And just as a follow-up, maybe you can just discuss your strategic priorities a little bit. There was limited buyback activity, it appears, in Q4, and Thomas mentioned M&A."
0," That generated $193 million. After paying for net pension contributions, our interest and our cost that we have for restructuring, severance, strategic initiatives mentioned earlier, and the Wickliffe ongoing cost. After we paid for those, we still had $114 million of excess cash."
0," The board met. There was a lengthy discussion and deliberation on the proposal as comparison to our long-range strategic plan and a decision was made, it was unanimous. Beyond that, I really can't comment."
0," The first one is on Premier League. Obviously, I'm not going to get you to comment on what your strategy is. But just in theory, if there was a, let's say, you paid less than all the analysts out there expect and you generated significant savings versus what we all put in our models."
0," The only thing I would add to that is that as we have said in our long-term plan, we will be very active in managing our portfolio. And that means not only doing JVs with existing assets that we have but also looking for new assets."
0," The quarter was quite heavy on CapEx. So, where the CapEx is going now and how does that fit with your strategy with WBS or Rain deal?"
0," The same amount of work to put all of these potential capital leases, capital lease obligations on to our balance sheet, and we really want to slow this down. Just to be clear, it does not kind of affect our ability to be successful in our Buy & Flip strategy. It's just a slightly different model for simplification reasons."
0," There's more things we're doing on the SG&A side, on the factory side, on the lean side, want to spend time on that. Here are our objectives, including financial objectives. And we feel are very committed."
0," They're good consumers, but they're not the ones that are going be out driving the business. So, over the last year or two, we've shifted our strategy. This is not an anti-aging, this is a cleansing device, right."
0," This debt consists solely of borrowings and line of credit in place for our stock repurchase program for which there've been no repurchases during 2017. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Shannon, who will provide our 2018 guidance and update you more on our strategic initiatives."
0," This included successfully integration of the distribution in Spain, Belgium, and South Africa. We will continue this journey in our strategy period from 2018 to 2022. And in 2018, two-thirds of all concept stores opened will be PANDORA-owned."
0," This is Aslan, CEO of DP Eurasia. I have GÃ¼venÃ§ DÃ¶nmez, the CEO of our Russian operation; and Selim Kender, our Chief Strategy Officer, with me also. Firstly, I would like to give a brief update on our maiden full-year trading statement following the IPO, and then we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have."
0," This trial is amongst the first level-one studies to compare in next-generation DCB with one that is commercially available. In Europe, we are still in the process of evaluating our strategy and timing of our assumptions to get the CE Mark, taking into consideration evolving EU regulations. We look forward to further progress in both the U."
0," Today, I'm going to lead you first just through our achievements in 2017 and highlight the key developments. Afterwards, I will report on the progress with the implementation of our strategic priorities. Carsten will then comment on detailed financials for the year."
0," Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Ramsey, Head of Investor Relations & Strategic Planning for Customers Bancorp. Please go ahead, sir."
0," Trent Determann, our Vice President-Finance, would typically join us on the call, but he is out today. During our transition period, Stephen, Trent and I will conduct earnings calls and handle interaction with the investment community, while Jerry Schuyler, our Interim CEO, will focus on organizational continuity, strategic initiatives and the search for a permanent CEO. As you may know, Russ Porter announced his resignation as Gastar's CEO late last month."
0," Two questions here. The Knickerbocker, what are your long-term plans, hold it, keep it, sell it? I know that was one FelCor has been trying to sell for a while."
0," We also continue to demonstrate the value of our partnerships with TAO Group, Boston Calling and CLG, as well as our newest acquisition Obscura Digital. And lastly, with regard to our venue expansion strategy, we've made important progress in the design of Las Vegas venue, and we look forward to sharing more soon. With that, I now turn the call over to Donna, who will take you through our financial results."
0," We are proud of this track record and continue to make thoughtful, sustainable dividend growth recommendations to our board.

0," We don't, of course, try to predict exactly which year actual losses will be above our estimate versus below our estimate. But if you look at our results over the last several years, look at the quality of our portfolio, you look at the quality of what we have now written, and you think about it indeed on a through the cycle basis as opposed to in a moment in time basis, you're referring to a spot interest rate, then, yes, we remain comfortable that the business that we're writing will facilitate that we achieve our objectives, including the ROE target for this segment."
0," We ended the quarter with a 35-day supply of used vehicles, which is a reasonable level of inventory.

0," We feel like we've got a very robust set of investments within our jurisdictions and very attractive jurisdictions that give us an opportunity to deliver benefits to customers and investors with the steps we've taken around the balance sheet, with the equity issuance that also positions us to support that organic growth. And so M&A is not a part of our strategic plan to achieve what we've laid out before you. We look at that as opportunistic, but are really comfortable with the organic plan we have set forth."

0," What are you looking at in terms of where you think your time allocation might be to those businesses? And I realized that you're putting a strategic plan in place, but any color there would be helpful."
0," What are you still looking to do before you progress into the clinic, and can you give us a taste of what you expect to be able to report in the first half of the year? And my second question would be, could you talk about your strategy in oncology more broadly?

0," With a comprehensive portfolio that is 100% performing, 100% senior secured and 95% floating rate, we believe we are well positioned for strong performance as we look ahead. Given our solid foundation, coupled with the earnings potential of our strategic initiatives, we believe Solar Senior has a clear path to generating incremental investment income as we carefully and opportunistically deploy our approximately $170 million of available capital. At last night's close of $16."

0," Within our Terahertz business, as you probably saw in our previous press release, we started 2018 with the hiring of a new general manager for that operation. Margaret Murdock is keenly focused on our objectives of reducing the cost of the product, improving its manufacturability, and penetrating new customers for industrial process control. She has, in her short tenure, already made good progress in the costs and the manufacturing objectives."
0," Yeah, Manav, I would just reiterate Rich's point. Essentially, the validation of our strategy confirms that the market is there, our products are there, the business model works. It's producing cash, it's producing momentum, but it's not producing enough momentum."
0," Yeah. And I think along those lines, Robin, we certainly take it into account what we think is happening in terms of the growth, with Motorcycles growing faster than Off-Road Vehicles through that long-term planning horizon. And as Scott alluded to, we made some improvements over the past year and a half from a Motorcycle standpoint."
0, Yeah. So do you   is a core party of your strategy monotherapy? It sounds like it's more about combinations for Pfizer as I think about this going forward?

0,"The FlexVolt technology allowed us to take cordless power tools and move up the power curve to 60 volt and 120 volt tools, but at the same time have that battery be backwards compatible for our existing 20 volt system. So it allows us to continue to build out the ecosystem of the DEWALT corded power tools system. FlexVolt is a great introduction of breakthrough technology that we launched almost two years ago now."
0,"So just bear with us as we execute on this plan. I think one of the most important points about this sale is that it will allow us to not only become, as I said, a Permian pure play, but actually it also makes us the only Midland Basin public pure play. And I think that's important because that's where all of our assets are."

This is a level that we believe allows us to maintain a high level of growth without significantly impacting our equity to total assets ratio. And that concludes the presentation."
0,"And there was a lot of interest and the first layer of the tax law, which is just the overall lowering of the corporate tax rate, the change 14% from 35% to 21%, which generally is a good thing because it makes us more efficient. It helps keep our rates low and allows us to get more capital in the ground. But as I described it to the regulators, and I was on this panel with Moody's and some Commissioner and Executive Director of Water division within one state, I called it the good, the bad, the ugly."
0,"Obviously, their plan is to try to grow that business by getting more share, getting more ASP, getting preamps to ramp. And so it's not like we're trying to limit ourself there, but we will kind of stick by our modeling, our models that we indicated earlier in the call which is preamp ramping is one of the aspects that allows us to keep HDD \\""""flat\\"""" over the year, but we're not really able to get into the numbers. But as we make progress, you should assume just like everything we've been doing we'll be more transparent."

Our post-service follow-up program allows us to be in touch with friends and family members who we've recently served.
